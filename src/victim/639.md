  Hmm, he must not see me waving at him because he's got a patch over his eye.

Ahoy! There be ... something! Up ahead! I don't know what it is, is
there any way to zoom? No? Yes? Does this manual have an index?

Yaarrrghh! That was ... cannon? Did we just get hit by a cannonball? Did
that ship shoot us? I can't tell. And those things up ahead, I'm pretty
sure they're rocks. Now it's raining. I can't say for sure, but as far
as I can *tell*, we're getting attacked by pirates in the middle of a
thunderstorm and we're headed right at something that looks just like
sharp, sharp rocks.

Keep your eye on the situation while I frantically flip through the
stupid manual. I would like to accomplish the bold seaman's maneuver
known as "steering," but I don't know what I'm doing. Do I use the
mouse? Do I press some keys? Dammit, why did they have to make *Pirates
of the Caribbean* so complicated!? Johnny Depp never had to look at the
manual!

Of course it doesn't help that [my pirate parrot keeps making zombie
noises](@/victim/570.md).

Wait! A cannonball just took out the main mast. I'm no nautical expert,
but I'm fairly certain that's a bad thing. So is this fire. And the
bodies. But at least my ship has slowed its inevitable rendezvous with
the rocks.

Hang on, why is the water level rising all around my ship? Is the tide
coming in? Maybe the nice men boarding my ship with those muskets and
swords are here to help me bail out some of this water.
