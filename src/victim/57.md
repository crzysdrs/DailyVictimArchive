I loved *Rainbow Six*, and I'm all for political intrigue and
suspense... but I know what makes a good video game, and baby, this
ain't it.

See, in the book these characters from the US Pentagram or something are
trying to stop another Spanish Civil War, just like the one that put the
fascist talk show host Fernando in power during the second World War. I
mean, right away, there's your first problem -- what would you call it?

*Tom Clancy's Spanish Civil War Stopper?*

And another thing, the whole thing so far is taking place in Spain.
Spain is full of Spanish people. Spanish people speak Spanish. I don't
speak Spanish! I wouldn't know what the hell was going on. Except for
that one phrase my Mexican friend taught me at band camp, which means
"Please take off your blouse." I doubt I would be able to use that to
stop a Spanish Civil War.

And lastly, why try to stop Civil Wars anyways? They're great excuses
for TV miniseries starring Patrick Swayze and Johnny Cash. If *I* were
to make a video game, it would be called:

*Phil Bertmann's Spanish Civil War Starter Upper*

After all, unless diplomacy fails, we'll never get a chance to use
violence to solve our problems.
