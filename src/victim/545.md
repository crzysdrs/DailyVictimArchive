Take your “Lembas Wafers,” for instance. Hard pieces of biscuit used for
traveling? Sure, that may have been great “back in the day,” but I hate
the stuff. Now those Keebler guys, though, they make a mean cookie.

And how about this “living magic” we’re supposed to always be playing
with. Hello! It’s the 2000s, already. Most of us tinker with
synthesizers and program our PCs. It’s also hard to find mithril
nowadays; I prefer the polo shirt. Swank.

In ages long past it’s true that the Elves went across the sea to the
West, to create an immortal paradise. Fact is, we landed in New Jersey.
Look at the place now. Sometimes, it sucks to live forever.

Nowadays I just spend all day playing *EverQuest* with the guys. Mock me
if you will, but it’s a hard, hard life. Let’s take today, for example.
I was supposed to be Best Man -- er, Best Elf -- at an online wedding.
But while walking to the bus stop I noticed that the house on the corner
had [an elvish symbol carved carefully into the
door](@/victim/544.md). It was the ancient Elvish symbol for
*vengeance*. I had no choice -- the call of the elders can’t be ignored,
even if it meant being late for the online wedding.

[![](/img/victimpics/jan03/elvessuck.png)](@/victim/544.md) **WHAT IS
THAT GUY WITH THE FAKE PLASTIC EARS DOING TO MY YARD!?**  
 I’d prefer to be in bed enjoying my hangover, but instead I woke up
this morning to find some skinny guy standing outside my door wearing
Spock ears and dousing my lawn with a garden hose. Then he covered my
house with glue and glitter. I tried to go back to bed but an hour later
I heard a wheelbarrow creaking along my sidewalk. I returned to the
window to find him planting *FLOWERS* all over my yard.
{% end %}

No doubt this was because of [my recent unorthodox *Warcraft III*
victory.](@/victim/544.md) I threw open the window, wincing at the
noise. “Is THIS the worst you stupid elves can do to me!?”

The skinny man looked up at me, than looked down at his flowers. He
seemed kinda crestfallen. One ear was slightly askew. “Yes,” he finally
admitted, hanging his head in shame.
