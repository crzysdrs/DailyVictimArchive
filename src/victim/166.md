Hi, I'm Mike, and I'm [still a saveaholic.](@/victim/157.md) Today I
read on a website that a new game coming out will be "challenging"
because ammo will be very limited. And yet, later in the same article,
the developer said, "but it'll still play like a PC game, meaning you'll
be able to save anywhere."

Well, if I could just soapbox for a bit, let me say that there's just no
point in giving me a game with Quicksave and telling me I have to
conserve my ammo. 'Cuz I'm the macdaddy of ammo saving. If you give me a
rocket, I will refuse to fire it. If you give me a special powerup that
I'm allowed to save, I'll never use it. If you give me a special smart
bomb that can only be used once in the entire game, you might as well
not even give it to me. Because I would rather quick-load a saved game
than *waste* them!

No no, I shoot a gun and then quick-load if I miss. I never use my
rocket launcher because it'll waste my precious rocket ammo. No sir.
Quick-save and Quick-load do the work of aiming for me.

I've never actually finished a game without a full compliment of
rockets, healing potions, powerups, and a backpack full of every goody
in the game. Now, people ask me, "Hey Mike, that's a waste. Why do you
save all that stuff and it ends up unused?"

Well, I think the answer is obvious: *Because I might need it later*.
