Yeah, so before, it was kinda a ritual. I would drive back from the
mall, see? Pull into the garage. Then I’d unwrap the box, shuff off the
plastic. I had to put that in my pockets. After that, I'd open the box,
and the manual would go in my jacket pocket, assuming it would fit. The
CD was precious cargo ... I'd have to stick it in my pants. And all that
extra cardboard, I had to crush and flatten it. If all went well, I
could jam it under the passenger seat for later disposal. The rebate
cards were a sure giveaway, and I didn’t want them to slip out in case
my wife had the car and made a sudden stop, so I had to set them on fire
and dispose of the ashes in the ashtray.

Nowadays it's a lot easier. The whole package fits right in my pants!
Lookie here: Blazing! Check out my package. No, look. See?
