*Knights of the Old Republic* will leave you howling like a worm! ...if
worms could HOWL! It'll hit you like a punch to the gut, a videogame
shot to the jimmies that deflates a lung and leaves you sobbing.

*Knights of the Old Republic* for the Xbox will shatter every bone in
your body. Your insides will crack like one of those Halloween
glowsticks and green light will shoot out of your mouth after you're
shaken. Your last words as you sink jelly-like to the floor will be
"THAT GAME ... IS ... SO COOL" before your vocal cords snap like rubber
bands and you're reduced to worshipful gurgling.

*Knights of the Old Republic* will make *Halo* look like *Nerf Lazer
Arena*. You're going to take out your *Halo* disk and break it in two
and you're gonna beg *Knights of the Old Republic* to forgive you for
ever thinking it was cool, tears flowing down your face before you
commit ritual Seppuku faced with the cruel knowledge that you have faced
the best game creation can produce and for you life no longer has
meaning.

*Knights of the Old Republic* will SUCK OUT YOUR LIVER and then it will
-- what? Oh no, I've not played it yet. No, I haven't seen it. Well,
there's a poster for it that I saw in a window in the mall, but I was
walking kinda fast. But I read a little bit about it in the forums from
some guy or something. Anyways, where was I? Oh yeah, LIVER SUCKING.

That is all.
