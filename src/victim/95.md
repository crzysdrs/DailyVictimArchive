  Also, I'd like to see how well Sarge can defend our house while locked in the garage.
  Bah.

Look, so yeah, so he came into your bedroom this morning dragging the
remnants of your computer wrist rest, causing you to cancel your golf
game and sending us all to the veterinarian to figure out what this
gelatinous ooze was coming from his mouth. But c'mon dad, he's *Sarge*,
he's not just a [Christmas puppy](@/victim/82.md), he's a born and
bred *fighting machine*.

Allow me to construct for you an alternate scenario. Bear with me here.
It's 4 AM, and silhouetted in the moonlight four shady figures race
silently across our rooftop. That's right dad, I'm talking about
[ninjas](https://web.archive.org/web/20010113000000/http://gamespy.com/comics/littlegamers/archives/20010111.html).
I've done [a lot of
research](https://web.archive.org/web/20010113000000/http://gamespy.com/comics/november00/angst30/)
on
[ninjas](https://web.archive.org/web/20010113000000/http://gamespy.com/comics/littlegamers/archives/20010109.html),
and you know despite what they're saying in Washington, I think they're
a real threat.

But Sarge here, see, I've been training him since day one to be a
[master of base defense](@/victim/17.md). His keen sense of
puppy-hearing was aware, while you quietly slept, of a ninja attempt to
take the family flag.

So picture this -- there's Sarge, stepping into your darkened study,
ready to throw down his life for the family. And at the windows he sees
them, ninjas, eyes glittering in the moonlight, weapons poised and
glinting. Now he knows, he's outnumbered! For the love of God, dad, he's
just a puppy! But he didn't back down from [Joey's Psychopathic
Dad](@/victim/84.md), and he wasn't gonna turn tail here. No way!

So desperately he straps your gel mousepad wrist-rest around his back,
and as soon as one of those ninjas quietly opened the window, he leapt
for the jugular. One down! Only now there's no element of surprise,
right? But Sarge has that under control too, see, he throws down the
lamp to the floor with a dull crash. Now, there's broken glass
everywhere, disabling the ninja rushing him, so Sarge can claw at his
hooded eyes. Two ninjas down, but then things get sweaty.

The third ninja dives under the couch, right? He's gonna attack Sarge
with blow darts. *Quad* poisoned blow darts. Because that's what they
do. They're ninjas. So Sarge, he's got no choice, he's got to get up on
the couch where it's safe, and he claws through the cushions, disabling
the ninja from above. Just like I taught him. Three down, but the last
one, knowing he's beat, isn't about to play fair -- he throws shuriken.
Those are throwing stars, dad, I've seen 'em. These guys were pros.

*But* that's the thing, right? Sarge was wearing your mousepad, and the
gelatinous material contained within stopped the shuriken and *saved my
puppy's life*. He's good, you know what I'm saying?

What do you mean, where are the bodies? They're ninjas, dad, they're
silent assassins. They don't leave bodies laying around. The fourth one
grabbed the evidence and took off. Duh.

So Sarge comes into your bedroom to show you what a good dog he is, and
the next thing you know, we're both grounded? Fine, dad, see if I care
if this family is flagless by the end of the month.
