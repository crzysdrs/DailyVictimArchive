In previous elections I just went into the booth and punched wild, all
Florida-Style. But now that I’m a little more responsible and less
knee-jerk when it comes to politics, I’ve settled down and did my
research to ensure that come Election Day, each and every vote of mine
is purely Pro-Videogame.

It’s a little hard to get all the facts. I mean, it’s not like “Gun
Control,” where everybody’s pretty much out in the open about where they
stand. As far as I can tell, there’s no aggressive videogame lobby yet
-- hmm, now *there’s* an idea! -- so you have to go to other sources.
Like old Oprah appearances.

Myself? I combed through the press and through CSPAN archival material.
For instance, one time they showed footage of *Grand Theft Auto* during
a debate on CNN and off to the side I caught Republican Incumbent R.
Samuelson pumping his fist with glee. He sure got my vote.

The tough part was deciding how to vote for local propositions. For
instance, that controversial new airport? I voted in favor of it. That
way the newest version of *Flight Simulator* will hopefully render my
house.

Similarly, I voted in favor of the freeway extension over by the port
district, since it’ll make for some cool jumps if they ever set the next
version of *Midtown Madness* in my city.

It’s hard to be a good citizen, but as an American, that’s my job.
