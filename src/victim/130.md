I have a dream.

I have a dream that one day there will be no online cheating. Imagine --
imagine all the people, playing as they should. It's easy if you try.
Friend, I have a dream. A dream where all pings are under 30. Where we
all have wireless LANs in every room in our home, and where new games
are downloaded onto our computers while we're at work, ready to be
played online via our invisible broadband connection when we get home.
Is that so wrong? Is it so wrong to dream?

Yes. I have a dream. I have a dream that one day 3D game engines will be
plentiful and easy to use, that anyone with an imagination would be able
to build 3D worlds and post them online. Oh yes. You might say I'm a
dreamer. You might call me crazy. But a dream is a wish, a wish your
heart makes, and I can't call my heart a liar. Oh no. I dream that in
this world of broadband and 3D and wireless, that anyone with a vision
for a game or a world or an experience to share can make it happen, that
we'll be awash in great games, up to our eyeballs in pure gaming content
-- beautiful content, true self-expression, realized in a virtual
worldwide community! Without walls! Without race! Without war or
disease! Yes, you can say I'm a dreamer. But I'm not the only one.

Another time, I had this dream that I was three inches tall, and I
wanted to take a drink from a humungous soda can, but it was filled with
a giant rat. Then, I was running from a floppy shop-vac hose, and found
myself trapped inside Saddam Hussein's ear canal with the cast from
Friends. It was pretty weird, that one.
