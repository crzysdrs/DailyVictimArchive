What's that? You're joking, that isn't ... it IS! A legitimate
[*Neverwinter
Nights*](http://web.archive.org/web/20020606000000/http://www.rpgplanet.com/planetnw/)
BETA CD! Early playable code, almost ready for release. Ohhhh.... look
how it sparkles in the morning light. Rainbow glimmers beaming from its
polished golden surface. Can I touch it? Can I rub it? Can I ... rub it
on my belly?

Look, what would it take for you to give me that CD? Hold off, don't put
it away. Every man has his price. Let me make you an offer. Ten things,
my friend. Ten things you get if you give me that *Neverwinter Nights*
beta CD.

**10.** My entire *Metal Gear Solid* action figure collection. Yes. Even
Sniper Wolf. All I request is a few minutes alone with her before I hand
them over.

**9.** My sister's telephone number. No, her *real* number, not the
1-800 number I gave you last time.

**8.** My unauthorized stash of Victoria's Secret catalogs. Everything
from their Summer '99 sale on.

**7.** You know that original Amazing Spider-Man issue 1 comic that I
have? That's *right!* I will LET you look at it. But you can't take it
out of the bag.

**6.** My whole DVD collection, which, while fairly small, does in fact
contain *Tron* and the anniversary edition of *Caddyshack.*

**5.** Uh ... steak. I will cook you steak.

**4.** A sensual massage.

**3.** The contents of my piggy bank. Here, shake it! You don't know
what's in there, but it's very very heavy! Wouldn't you like to find out
how much lewt is inside? Just hand me that shiny CD and you'll know!

**2.** These burned pajamas are all that remains of Adolf Hitler.

**1.** Denise Richards' Email address. NO JOKE. Don't ask me how *I* got
it, but I know how *you* can get it!

Just hand over the CD! C'mon! ... I'll be your friend?
