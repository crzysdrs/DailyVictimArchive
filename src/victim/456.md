So, you ask me, what could I do for your company? Sure, I'm a recent
college grad and yes, my resume is awfully light and *sure*, my
grade-point-average wasn't great and *OKAY*, so maybe there was that
felony conviction. But I think I'd be a real asset in this entry level
position.

Why? Because, thanks to [*Super Mario
Sunshine*](http://web.archive.org/web/20020903000000/http://www.planetnintendo.com/features/gcn/reviews/sunshine/),
I've honed my platform-jumping skills to *perfection.* I'm a razor-sharp
platforming *savant*.

Hang on, don't reach for your phone just yet. This isn't an idle boast.
I can jump on moving platforms or stationary platforms. I can jump on
rotating platforms. I can jump on spinning platforms, the kind that dump
you off if you're not careful. Sir, if it's floating above a void, I can
find a way to jump on it and -- moreover, what should really appeal to
your team -- I can find a way to jump *off* of it and land *precisely*
on another similarly precarious platform.

This is no one-shot deal, either. No, I can jump from platform to
platform hovering mysteriously over a great void for *hours on end*. I'm
willing to do that for your team.

I'm also really good at watering plants.
