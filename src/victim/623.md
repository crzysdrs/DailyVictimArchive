  Great, now I've got to take off all my weapons and run naked into the Plane of Time
  until I lose everything. What a grind.

No, NO! Take it back! I don't want that sword -- no, I don't care about
the increased odds of a critical. Something like this makes my character
more valuable, and that can't happen.

Because [My Dwarf is a Tax Writeoff!](@/victim/615.md)

I've already claimed him as a business loss with the IRS. But now,
there's some kind of [League of Extraordinary
Twinkers](@/victim/490.md) who keep running up and buffing me and
killing stuff. Stop it! Just stop it!

Get these buffs offa me!

This afternoon I spent an hour and a half running *away* from my corpse,
only to have someone by the guild hall replace all of my equipment "To
help a guy in hard times." Look, I'm not in hard times. I'll BE in hard
times if the IRS gets wind that I the two-handed Blade of War!

What if they do an audit!?
