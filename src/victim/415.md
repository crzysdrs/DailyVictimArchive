  Let's think about this. An orphanage is a big building with a lot of beds. If it
  weren't for all those children, it'd be a perfect brothel. So I'm thinking, 'poison,'
  you catch me?

I think you know what I'm talking about. If we're gonna play
*Neverwinter Nights* together, we've got to lay down the law, or lack
thereof. That means nobody here is gonna slip up and go chaotic with our
evil. No sir, we're Lawful Evil. That means eternal evil vigilance.

So let's look at what just happened here. You just launched a fireball
into an orphanage that asked for our help. Any lesser evil party
would've applauded that action, but here, by and by, we've got to THINK.
There are a lot of possibilities with orphanages that you failed to
explore. Child slavery, for instance. Or we coulda rented the building
out for Ninja training. We could've adopted some of those kids, used
them as bait for a dragon, while we snuck in the back way and took the
treasure. THINK, man, THINK!

We don't accept any half-assed evil here. Only the real deal.
