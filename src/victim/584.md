Okay, okay, I think everyone’s here. Hey! Quiet down, give it a rest.
Here’s the deal. Steve and I had a little [falling
out](@/victim/580.md) over his [poor performance as Tingle when we
play *Zelda*](@/victim/581.md), and we think he [took it
personally](@/victim/582.md). Now he’s [gone
berserk](@/victim/583.md), as you might have guessed by the presence
of police choppers overhead. It’s up to us to get him out of this mess.

But, in order to FIND a Tingle, we have to THINK like Tingles. No no
Jer, not “thing that tingles,” I said “THINK like TINGLES.”

He ran off into the woods with a grappling hook and a boomerang. So,
let’s start right here, with this underbrush. What you’re looking for
are *patches of tall grass*, which should of course be [cut on sight to
see what’s inside](@/victim/574.md). Chop! CHOP!

Hey hang on a second. The woods end just up ahead. What’s this loading
dock back here? Are we behind the Northgate Plaza? Then that means that
that building would be ... OH ... MY ... GOD.

It’s a *Pottery Barn*.

This place is like a Tingle *magnet*. Follow me. Avoid the searchlights
from the police choppers! He’s in here, I can feel it. Okay, start
SMASHING! C’mon people, smash! Smash already!

Wait, lie low. Is that the cops? No, I guess not — it’s just some guy
leaning out his car window and yelling “woo.” Keep smashing!
