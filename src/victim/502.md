  What do you mean, "I shoulda called Triple-A." Last I checked, they don't sell games
  either ... what? You mean they pick locks for you? Whoa, professional carjackers.
  Why haven't I heard of these guys?

You know that if you didn’t pre-order [*Grand Theft Auto: Vice
City*](http://web.archive.org/web/20021030000000/http://gamespy.com/previews/october02/gtavicecityps2/),
you’re pretty much screwed in this town? Both the big software stores
are sold out, even the one with [that dude in a bear
suit](@/victim/106.md).

So I’m driving all around town in my dad’s car -- you know, the silver
VW Jetta (Mine’s in the shop after I tried to jump a picnic table with
it, remember?) And I got no choice but to head all the way out to
Fountain Valley. I storm into the Best Buy there and I catch some guy
opening up a cardboard box -- man, I musta left skid marks. He took one
look at me and without saying a word he handed me the game. SCORE!

On the way home I stop at Commander Taco -- you know the one in the big
mall? -- just so I could run inside real quick and hook up with some
food. ‘Cuz I figured I’d be jackin’ cars all night.

But I must’ve been in a hurry, ‘cuz I get out to the parking lot and ...
okay, for one thing, it’s real easy to lose a silver VW Jetta in a
crowded parking lot, it just doesn’t stand out. For another, *I locked
my keys in the car*. There it was, *Grand Theft Auto: Vice City*, just
sitting there staring at me from the passenger seat while my keys
dangled tauntingly from the steering wheel.

Times like this, I ask myself: What would a common criminal do?

The answer was to go to the hardware store and get a hammer.

I come back with the hammer -- price tag still hanging off of it, hear?
-- and I’m walking around looking for the Jetta. I see it, and I make
sure nobody is looking, right? Even though it’s a crowded parking lot.
Anyways, the coast seemed clear, so WHAMS!! I smash the driver’s side
window. I jump in, slide into the seat, slam the door, and go to turn
the key amidst the blaring of the alarm ... and the keys aren’t there. I
look over to the passenger seat, and my game isn’t there either.

*I was in the wrong Jetta.*

Yah, so, uh, here I am. No man, I don’t have the car, I ran all the way
here on foot. I’m hoping to go back and get it once the fuzz dies down.
Hey, you mind if I bury this hammer in your yard?
