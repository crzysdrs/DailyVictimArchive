  You know what else is big? Flatscreens. But I'm gonna hold off on that one. At least
  until 3:30 or so.

You know, it was *hours* ago that I first realized how I'm desperately
needing another 512MB of RAM. I've slogged on long enough. Don't get me
wrong. I like to delay a little on any new hardware purchase, 'cuz
prices tend to drop. But let's see -- it's already -- what? 3PM? I just
gotta pull the trigger and grab that extra RAM.

Hmmm... while I'm at it... I might want to consider upgrading my 3D
card. I've got a GeForce 3 in there now. But I don't want to rush into
anything. I'm gonna get the RAM, then I'm gonna think about getting that
new 3D card. You want to take your time with stuff like that.

Hold on a sec while I place my order ... there we go. Hey, what time is
it? Quarter after? DAMN, man, I've been puttering around with this old
GeForce 3 for nearly 15 minutes now. Sometimes you just gotta say enough
is enough! You certainly can't say I've been imprudent. No sir, I put
off getting that GeForce 4 for nearly 20 minutes. It's time to make the
big jump, you know?
