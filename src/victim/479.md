blurb: >
  This fellow claims that he IS a "Rocket Jump," forcing me to question what IS or
  ISN'T a "Rocket Jump." Perhaps if I shoot him I will understand. Hmm. No, no I don't,
  but I sure feel better about it.

That’s right, Dadaists. You know? From the Dada movement? Those who use
art to question the nature of art, staging bizarre performances or
sculpting non-sensical pieces in order to make us re-evaluate our
definition of “art?”

Well, yes. Anyways, what I think what they’re doing HERE is using this
*Unreal Tournament* Bombing Run server to question the very nature of
“Bombing run.”

Why is that guy up on top of the obelisk? How did he get there? What
possible function could he hope to serve his team? How about the man
hopping in the corner? Does he even know he’s playing? Or, does he just
want me to question the very nature of how I define “play” itself?

Also worth noting: why is that man with the flak cannon shooting flak
into the air until it rains gently down as a curtain of steel? It was
kinda cool the first couple of shots. But he’s been doing it for two
full minutes. Wait, now he just turned and shot the guy in the corner
who was jumping up and down. It’s as if these performance artists have
peeled open the game like an onion and are exposing its hidden layers
for all to see.

Right in front of the enemy goal, a circle of four players are throwing
themselves down into the pit to watch their limp bodies crumple over the
pipes, chanting “Be in my clan! Be in my clan!” Look, I don’t have ANY
idea. All I know is I threw one of those guys the ball once and he
started spinning in place screaming “Is it out yet?”

It’s all very illuminating. I think.
