Today was another terrible day at the office. First the mail server
crashed, then my report didn’t go through, then the sandwich cart guy
overturned the bagel rack, and then this afternoon my boss tried to fire
himself. I’m serious. He stood up in a meeting and announced, “I’m sick
of my crap! When I want something done, I expect myself to do it! From
the moment I came in here I had myself pegged as a troublemaker. I heard
me, mister — I’m through! I’m gonna make sure I never work in this
industry again!” Then he called security and tried to have himself
escorted from the building.

You know what I want?

I want to play *Battlefield: 1942* for a living.

I’d come home from work and plop my briefcase on the floor. “Whoo-ee,
honey!” I’d say, loosening my tie. “It was a rough day on the server.
The Japs had a carrier and some really good pilots. Me and Dennis had to
back the tank into a warehouse to avoid the falling bombs. Stevens
almost lost the flag, but together we hunkered down and took it back. By
the time the Japs were ashore, we’d mined all the bridges, just like
we’d planned at the quarterly review.”

Then I’d say, “I gotta tuck in early tonight. Tomorrow I need to come in
early because we’re planning to play on Stalingrad and I need to secure
the north building.”

I’d hang up my coat, put my feet on the copy table, and click on the
history channel, or maybe one of those Discovery Channel specials on
modern military hardware. “Gotta study up — you know, for work,” I’d
say.

Then I’d squeeze cheese right out of a can into my mouth.
