My friend and I were excited about [*Star Wars
Galaxies*](https://web.archive.org/web/20010823000000/http://www.gamespy.com/e3/StarWarsGalaxies/),
the [skull-splortching](@/victim/201.md) massively multiplayer Star
Wars game. My greatest dream is to some day be a Jawa. We decided to
join one of those "Player Associations" that were forming, so that we
could actually start to roleplay once the game came out. Weeks later, we
feel dirty and used.

Our Player Association is filled with people named things like Nraduu
Blakic and KDIOUGekl welksjfdasoidIDD. They were going to found a
player-made city. The Mayor of the city -- mind you, a city that doesn't
exist for a game that hasn't come out -- proceeds to set up an email
ring that runs like an oil spill. Daily (or more) updates contained info
on: how many citizens had joined that day, details on the next city chat
time and rules, changes to those chat rules, a logo contest, voting for
the logo contest, why we have to vote again, updated rules for the city,
arguments over rules for the city, speculations on resource gathering,
details on why the Mayor thought three citizens had left but had not,
and (absolutely true) the details on the Mayor's freak medical problem
where he thought he was having a stroke.

We pray daily for a denial of service attack on his ISP.
