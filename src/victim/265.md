Come sit on my knee, son. [remember the talk we had a couple weeks
ago?](@/victim/249.md) I think it's time for another.

See son, when adults get in to drive a Havoc Heavy transport to the
enemy base, they know to slow down and wait until other people get on.
They *share*. Adults love to share. Sharing is good.

Adults also talk to each other. They ask one another to repair each
others' generators. They say "please" and "thank you." Occasionally they
also scream, "I got your number! I got all your numbers!" but daddy says
that's not nice. No, son, us grownups talk to one another before we
shoot people with spinfusors.

I know it's hard out there in the real world, son. Kids like to pick on
other kids who have the flag. They're mean that way. But it's no
different for adults. Frankly son — and don't tell mom I said this —
if someone were to take *my* flag? I'd put a boot so high up their ass
they'd be coughing shoe leather. Don't repeat that.

But what I'm saying son, is don't let those kids get to you. They're
just *jealous* because you have the flag, and jealous kids do mean
things with grenade launchers. Got all that? 'Attaboy! Go to it, son!
