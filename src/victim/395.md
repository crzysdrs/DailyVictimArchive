Hi, I fear change.

And your new [GameSpy.com
design](https://web.archive.org/web/20020619000000/http://www.gamespy.com/),
with it's giant Jango Fett leaping out of the page at me, is scary down
to the gonadal level. As soon as it loaded I clawed my eyes and prayed
for a swift death. Look at all the content, and how it's organized. I
hate organization, it underscores my own inadequacy and imperfections.

Might I suggest an alternate design?

I imagine a webpage composed entirely of raw meat, juxtaposing high
technology with the frailties of flesh. When you click on links, they
should randomly take you to other links, demonstrating life's
insecurities. Then, when people sent email to complain, the feedback
form would show a picture of a faceless mannequin in a dark green fog
while random xylophones clack in the background. I don't know what it
would signify, but there would be an emptiness there more akin to the
hollow void that is my ongoing struggle with life.

Oh, and your logo should use that cool rippling water effect. It's the
biz.
