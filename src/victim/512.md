Holy sweet bejeebus. Will you look at this? I barely just met this chick
on *EverQuest* and already she’s sending me the *kinky* emoticons.

Like, look at this one, check it out: She sent me a less-than sign
followed by the number three. That’s right, “&lt;3”. What the hell is
that? What does that mean?

Did I just get teabagged?

Maybe it’s supposed to be a pair of short, stubby fingers. Is she giving
me the peace sign, or flashing gang symbols? I’m fine with joining an
*EverQuest* guild, but I’d best be staying out of “the hood” if that’s
what she’s getting’ on with.

What? Oh ... oh, it’s supposed to be a *heart*. A sideways heart. Ah, I
get it, yah I see it. Hunh.

Gotta say I’m kinda disappointed man. A heart? Blah. Look, how about I
just pretend she sent me a pair of boobs and go to bed happy? Yeah,
that’s the new plan. Back me up on this one.
