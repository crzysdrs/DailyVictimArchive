Hello fellow
[ForumPlanet](https://web.archive.org/web/20010621000000/http://www.forumplanet.com/)
regulars. I, like you, was very excited when I downloaded the first
screenshot of *Mystic Empires IV: Blood Oath, the Redemption*. At first
glance, I could see instantly that this game had the potential to offer
me everything I've ever wanted: turn-based grand strategy with real-time
combat, RPG-like character development, and first-person dungeon
exploration. Like you, I was stoked.

But then I looked at the *other* two screenshots, and MAN, lemme tell
you, is this game gonna BLOW! Look at that one chick with the sword --
cheyya, right! Also, that building you can kinda see in the background
totally blows. And the last screenshot was of a CG cutscene, which
didn't look like it was going to be as good as something Blizzard could
do. What are they trying to say, their gameplay is so piss-poor that
they have to release screenshots of the in-game movies? C'mon you
morons, read between the lines. The game won't be out for two years, but
I can already tell you, with authority, how much it's going to suck.

I also took the time to read the press release. The title of the press
release was too long, and the third paragraph was awfully vague about
how the economics were going to work. What does that tell me? It tells
me that this game is gonna suck ass and blow chunks. Mark my words. I
called it first.
