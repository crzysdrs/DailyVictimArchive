This evening I had a Moment of Clarity.

I was spending my paycheck at Palace Park Amusements, you know, the
place with the McDonalds and the little birthday room and the video
games and the rugrats all over the place? They have that new Silent
Scope arcade game, where you get to aim a fake sniper rifle and shoot
people and pretend they're your second stepdad.

Anyways, next to that machine is this game called "The Claim Jumper,"
and it's one of those ones where you drop tokens in and try to get
tickets. Like Skee-ball, except it won't get you laid.

Ordinarily I'd never waste my money on something like that, but as I was
sniping people, I felt this warmth spreading through me, like warm pee
in a snowsuit. I was drawn toward the flashing, twinking, Claim Jumper
machine. I swear I heard harps playing. And I held my coin above the
slot, and I heard this deep voice cut through the noise of the Dance
Dance Revolution machine, and it said ... "Lawrence." Just like that,
only deeper — "Lawrence." It was the voice of God. It moved me, yet
frightened me.

Especially since my name is Mike.

And when the voice said, "DROP THE DUCATS!" I let the coin rip, and it
twirled down the slide, and it landed *right in one of those little
minecarts*. The minecart was full of tokens. The game was playing music,
but all I could hear was a choir. A bright light shone on my face! And
bells were ringing, glorious bells, and the machine started peeling out
tickets — hundreds of tickets! You know how many I won? Fifteen hundred
tickets!

By the grace of God!

Fifteen hundred tickets!!

Fifteen ... hundred ... tickets.

My life has been changed forever. I mean that. I touched the Creator
today, I'm sure of it.

Only 48,000 more, and I can get a mousepad.
