  I can understand, almost *expect* his betrayal ... but I can't believe that Mr.
  Whiskers went along so complacently.

What frustrated me the most about *Warcraft III* was my inability to
keep control of my units once my forces grew large enough. It's like, as
soon as I rolled my army out of my base, Ted would march his hero in
through the back door. Worse, my defenses would always be chasing off
after something else. I had come to the conclusion that I sucked.

But yesterday evening, after another hearty pounding, I decided to
abandon the few peons that remained and walk over to congratulate Ted.
Upstairs I went, down the hall with the flickering fluorescents, then
into the darkened set of cubicles next to the humming server farm. Ted
sat there in his giant rotating chair, a series of ten monitors around
him in two semi-circular stacks. He was frantically working several mice
and keyboards, and didn't even notice me walk up.

What I saw on the screens stunned me. Maps of *Warcraft* on all of them,
each one showing a different players' perspective. Ted was using the
remote desktop application to snoop on us all! I watched as he leaned
over to check out Crenshaw's base, then he reached up and flicked a
mouse to send Crenshaw's defenses off somewhere else. Afterwards he
attacked the abandoned base, chuckling in a low throaty growl. "His
insolence must be punished," he said aloud.

"WHAT are you DOING!?" I blurted.

Ted froze in mid-motion and then slowly turned around in his seat. He
was stroking the office cat, and seemed completely unabashed. "We meet
again, Mr. Balmer," he said. "But it appears now that *I* have the upper
hand!"

"What are you talking about?" I asked, pointing at the screens. "You're
*cheating!*"

He raised a gloved fist. "There is no 'good' and 'evil,' boy. Only
POWER, and those willing to SEIZE IT!" As I stormed off in a huff, he
called after me: "I am GOD here, Balmer! You hear me? GOD!"
