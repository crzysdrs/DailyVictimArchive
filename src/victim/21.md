  I've been hearing rumors that many of you are voting based on what you heard about
  my sister on the Quake server last week. Once again, we are NOT auctioning her off
  on E-Bay. You're thinking about my HALF-sister, who is still available.

Okay, let me set the record straight.

First of all, while it IS true that I had the enemy flag for over ten
minutes without my knowledge as I sniped, this has no bearing on my
mother's sexual preferences. My mother, to my knowledge, has always
preferred men, at least until the recent medications dulled her sex
drive.

Secondly, in a moment of distraction it is in fact true that I
accidently crashed an APC into our own solar panels, killing everyone on
board and destroying our base's power supply. However, my mother's
status upon marriage is indisputable -- she was only 15 when she tied
the knot, so it's hardly true she could've had intimate relations with
the ENTIRE National Rifle Association before then. Also, I assure you
that my mother was very faithful in her marriage, it was my father who
slept around with every soccer mom he could find before his cement truck
overturned and left us on welfare. So there.

I'd also like to address what was said about the farm animals. While it
is true that my mother grew up on a farm before the foreclosure, her and
my grandparents and my numerous, often illegitimate uncles raised
chickens only. I ask you to explain how it was physically possible for
her to engage in those alleged acts with a chicken, hm? I think I rest
my case!

How then, do we explain her lingering depression, rampant alcoholism,
and inability to hold a job for more than three consecutive days?
Frankly, these things are primarily my fault. When ordered to defend the
base, I did in fact wander off of the map. This is due to generations of
inbreeding, and not -- as some have claimed -- to the habitual usage of
inhalants which I swear I quit several weeks ago.

So lay off my momma.
