  Sorry, no more tanks. But I got a Kubel here with a bad muffler and no front brakes,
  any takers? Yeah, like you need brakes.

Yah yah, heil heil and all that, listen up. I’ve been an engineer in
this army since the *first* World War, and not since we drove around in
cardboard boxes have I seen tanks driven as lousy as your epileptic
maneuvering. This is a *Panzer*, man. My BABY. Don’t you know how to
drive tanks in [Battlefield
1942?](http://web.archive.org/web/20020822000000/http://www.fileplanet.com/files/110000/111652.shtml)

Don’t lie to me about hidden enemy anti-tank campers. I saw what
happened to the last tank I gave you. You tried to drive it into a
plane. An airborne plane. By driving off of a cliff.

In fact, lemme give you just a general piece of advice: Whenever you
have to parachute out of a tank? *You’re driving it wrong.*

And what about the tank before that? The one you were busy backing
toward the anti-aircraft gun?

Or the one before that, the one you tried to “rocket jump” with?

Look here, Kommandant. You’re acting like tanks just grow on flagpoles
around here! Well, they – yeah, okay, so maybe they do. But still, you
should – hey, come back here! Come back! Look you’ll – oh for crying out
crap -- *YOU CAN’T RAM A DESTROYER.* \*sigh\*
