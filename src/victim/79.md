Oh yes indeedly! Thanks to the [Secret Santa
Giveaway](@/victim/78.md) at work, I now have a sniffy new Action
Figure of Morpheus from the Matrix! You know, the dude with the pills?

Let's see, he comes with a shotgun and a mac-10. Which will most
effectively broadcast to the world that I am in fact a badass when I set
him on my monitor? You can't make these decisions lightly!

The guy in the cubicle next to mine suggests that I put one gun in each
hand. Bah! That would be so excessive as to dilute the effect -- it
would make it seem like I was *trying* to *look* like a badass, instead
of revealing to all within eyeshot the fact that I *truly am* a badass.
But what does he know? [He just plays Asheron's Call all
day](@/victim/23.md).

I've got it! I'll definitely use the mac-10 in his right hand, with his
finger not even on the trigger, like, you know, he just knows he's got
the powah. Then, I will raise his left hand out like so, in a sort of
conciliatory gesture, palm upward. Sorta like he's saying, "What? What?
You want some of me? You want this?" Yes -- yes, that's it. Now he is
the perfect plastic representation of my ass badness. He can go here,
next to the stuffed Pikachu.

Nobody will mess with me now.
