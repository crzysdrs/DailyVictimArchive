  Yessir, I never met an ancient I didn't like. Although, if I did, it wouldn't be
  for his lack of the it bringing, that's for sure. I think. Read that back to me...

Allow me to answer on your behalf: Yes, yes you do.

Back in the early days of *Morrowind* I requested that the people of the
town of Balmora [Bring It](@/victim/373.md), and bring it they did.
It was brung. They bronged it. And as a result, that stupid po-dunk town
was littered wrists-to-ankles with a string of corpses nearly two
hundred yards wide -- at least, by my estimation, as far as I could tell
while I was running from the guards.

But now I see here from the cover of the box that there’s a whole new
area of the game to explore in this expansion pack. What’s this?
Mournhold, the ancient capital city? I bet it’s full of people falling
over themselves with the desire to Bring It. Oh look, Goblins? Bring It.
Liches? It-Bringers. “Mysterious Fabricants?” Look, I know how they can
answer the mystery: By Bringing it. There’s even what they’re calling
Epic-Sized dungeons, in which IT will be BRUNG -- that much I’m willing
to put in writing.

My desire to have it Brought to me and answered in kind stems as you
might suspect from my ancient claymore, unearthed from timeless crypts,
which I have chosen to dub “Righteous Rage.” It’s difficult to read the
runes etched along the hilt by ancient hands, so encrusted are they with
the blood of the unbelievers, but allow me to translate. That’s a “B”
followed by an “R” and then an “I” “N” “G” ... aw, you know the rest.
Those ancients, they were on to something.
