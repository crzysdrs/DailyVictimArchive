  Have you ever considered hitting CTRL-A? CTRL-A selects ALL. Everything. Then you
  can cut it. You can CUT EVERYTHING, with the touch of a couple buttons. The ability
  to destroy all that man has wrought. Right there. On your keyboard.

Hello.

Did you know that standard PC configurations have FOUR keys for editing
text? You can cut, you can copy, and you can paste. With *ease*.

There's also an "undo" key, but, I'm a little scared of undoing things.
You know, once you've done something, you can't take it back. So I don't
want to get into the habit.

Me? I don't just like to cut. I like to *paste*. Did you know you can
cut something, then paste it somewhere else? I can do that. Some people
like to *copy* before they paste. They're weak-willed, small people who
should just donate their organs and be done with it. I used to do that,
by the way. Not the organ-donating part, obviously, but back when I was
insecure: I'd copy, then I'd paste. Then I'd go back and cut out what I
originally copied. Do you follow me? Nowadays, I'm much more older,
secure, and self-confident. I've killed a man in cold blood. If I want
to just CUT, then PASTE? None of you can stop me. You can try ... oh
yes, they'll try ... but no one can stop me. From cutting. And then...
PASTING.
