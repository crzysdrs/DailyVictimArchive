Hel-looo? What is this? It's topping out at 160? Look ... look here! Not
realistic. My stock Viper out in the parking lot can break 200 on a
straitaway. Hell, I can break 90 *in* the parking lot. I've squealed out
of the handicapped space that fast on more than one occasion.

Look at this -- look at the curve here -- I could take that corner at
120 on *my* Viper and barely spit rubber. Absurd. This is a mockery of
the Dodge name. A personal assault on *me* and my chances of winning
this weekend's tournament.

It's times like this I'm glad I'm pre-law. I'm gonna call up Dodge and
offer to represent them in a law suit. Sony's a big company -- phat yen
-- I think we can take these chumps. Sue their asses, good ol' US of A
style. We'd win. 'Cuz God drives Dodge.

I ended up betting that [schmuck from the frat
house](@/victim/254.md) a couple hundred bucks I could take him on in
the tourney. I assumed I would be able to drive a *Viper*, not a
Viperesque half-vipe. Good thing I swiped his memory card when he wasn't
looking.

\[*Gran Turismo 3 Week continues at the Daily Victim! One week of
hardcore racing, backstabbing, and smack talk culminating in the big
tournament this weekend. Which victim will win? Stop by all week to
vote.*\]
