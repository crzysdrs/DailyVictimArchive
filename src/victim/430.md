Hold on a second, pull over. What the hell is this? I asked Craig to go
online and get us directions to the KFC, but I think he used the Xbox
and got his directions from *Crazy Taxi* instead.

Allright, let's just take it nice and slow. Take a right here. Okay,
now, uh, he says to "Crazy Drift between the two semis." That's not very
helpful. Oh! Here's the movie theatre, turn left.

Now you're supposed to ... uh ... "do a crazy dash" over a trashcan and
then a crazy jump off the rear of a flatbed truck, skidding over the
roof of the theatre on two wheels. Hmm. I'm pretty sure he didn't use
MapQuest to get these directions.

Eh, but what the hell, we're lost. Buckle up and try it!
