  You Anymore!

Week after week it's MY ass on the line there with the defuse kit,
hunched over that beeping lump of plastic just so you guys can respawn
with a little extra cash. I could just hide in the corner and wait for
the bomb to go off, so that I'd start the next round with all my weapons
and ammo. But NO, I'm riskin' my butt for you guys!

And you go and date my sister.

Well, that's just fine. You know, I can't stop you. All I'm gonna say
is, next time? I'm leavin' the bomb. That's right. I don't care about
national honor or teamplay or any of that crap, the thought of you
bumpin' uglies with my sis gives me the chokes, dude. So that's it. If
that bomb's beepin', I'm just gonna hide underneath a train car or
something. You're gonna see my bomb-squad butt high-tailing out of there
faster than you can invite her to the prom.

So there!
