You heard me, billion-dollar game publisher! Your latest title is but a
BREATHER to me, I can buzz through the whole thing between classes like
I was playing a game of Windows Solitaire! Your new game that you spent
three years of painstaking development time to produce is barely a speed
bump to me. It's over quicker than my parents having sex. I can rip
through it like Sherman through Georgia. Hah hah!

To what do I owe my success? That's right, I actually played through and
beat *Contra: Shattered Solider*. It took my months to do. But now my
Contra-honed reflexes eat up other games like they're an appetizer. But
a small appetizer, like the kind you get at fancy restaurants, where
it's like one bite of food on a big plate with sauce all dribbled
decoratively over it. That's what your game is: barely a mouthful! A
nibble!

After beating *Contra*, lesser games look like sceensavers to me!

I can beat your game in less time than it takes to install it! I can
beat your game in less time than it would take the opening cinematic to
play! I played through the entire third level during a single stifled
yawn. I scratched my nose during the fourth level and missed the whole
thing. IS THAT ALL YOU GOT!?
