Hi Jared, meet the GameSpy readers. GameSpy? This is Jared, with the
sideburns. Yeah, as I was explaining, Jared here is in what I call
"*Doom III* Denial." You see, after John Carmack [said that *Doom III*
will only have four-player synchronized
multiplayer](http://web.archive.org/web/20020821000000/http://www.gamespy.com/articles/august02/quakecon2002/carmackqa/index2.shtml)
instead of client-server deathmatch, Jared here has lapsed into some
sort of fantasy world.

"No no man, that whole four-player thing Carmack was talking about ...
he means co-op mode."

You see what I mean? There's no co-op mode. I'm sorry Jared, he was
talking about multiplayer. It's peer to peer, like the original *Doom*.
Four players, max.

"No, what he *meant* was that you *could* play four player synchronized,
you know, when you weren't playing with 64 other people on an Internet
server."

Now, you see, there you go again, putting words into John Carmack's
mouth. He flat out said "The multiplayer is probably going to be
four-player small stuff. One-on-one or two-on-two type situations."

"But, John Carmack is like ... a programmer. When he said '4' players,
he must have been talking in Hexidecimal."

Jared, man, the Hexidecimal equivalent of 4 is ... 4. Four players.

"No, the *original* Doom had four players, that's what he must've been
talking about. Then Quake came out with 16 players. Then in QuakeWorld
you could have 32 players. Quake 2 had 64 player servers. The next
logical step for *Doom III* is 256 players. Yeah, yeah I'm sure that's
what he meant."

Jared, dude, you're eventually gonna have to face up to the truth sooner
or later.

"Okay, okay. Sixteen players."

Four. Four, Jared, FOUR PLAYERS.

"No! He ... he must've meant four...*teen!* Fourteen players. Yeah,
that's EXACTLY what he said."
