  MGD, eh?

Look -- look at this! It's ... sagging! At first I thought with glee
that [an alien was going to emerge from my stomach](@/victim/137.md)
but it turns out that I'm just *gaining weight*. I haven't gained weight
since I finished my 9th grade growth spurt. Now look at me. I can't even
roll the chair toward my desk without a big ol' roll of fat clomming up
the keyboard tray.

This is disgusting. I have to suck in my gut to play *Tribes 2*. Oh --
oh look, the screen is blurry. My eyes are going! I can't remember where
I was going to plant this spike turret -- I think I'm going senile. Did
my thumb just crack as I pressed the mouse button for my grenade
launcher? Did it? I'm getting arthiritic! Turn the volume up, I think
I'm losing my ears.

It's all growing dim. Look at my poor, poor reflexes. I bet I have colon
cancer. Did someone just fling a mortar at me or am I getting a
cataract? No loud noises please! My heart! My weak heart! Man, as soon
as a guy hits 23 he just falls apart, you know what I'm saying?
