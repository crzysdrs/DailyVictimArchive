Extra! Extra! Five slain in [*Soldier of Fortune II* Multiplayer
Test](http://web.archive.org/web/20020508000000/http://www.fileplanet.com/index.asp?file=87213)
during what police are calling a "possible camping-related fatality."
Details hazy regarding multiple homicide over small attache.

Less than a minute after the round started \[PFB\]WhamDoodles --
believed to be numbered among the dead -- shouted for help in the
kitchen over teamchat. Police ballistics expects suspect the room was
then spammed with grenades, leading to unconfirmed reports of the
assaulting team being "TOTAL WHORES."

FireDude1160, sole survivor of the camping incident that followed,
denies reports that he was a whiny little bitch. "I have not, nor have
ever been, a whiny little bitch," he told reporters. "I'm merely
reiterating documented proof that they were like TOTALLY camping the
briefcase."

"You bunch of pussies," he later added.

\[JK\]Bungh0le, alleged camper, denies any wrongdoing. "You're SUPPOSED
to guard the briefcase," he claimed in a written statement to the press.
"Duh." He also claims that during the time of the alleged camp he was
all up in FireDude's juice, gunning that whiny bitch down in the
hallway. Witnesses can neither confirm nor deny the degree to which
Bungh0le was all up in the juice of his opponent.

FireDude's juice remains unavailable for comment.
