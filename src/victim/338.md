  This morning, to my horror, I found a diamond stud on the floor of my dining room.

It's true. Gary Gygax, co-creator of *Dungeons & Dragons*, quite
possibly the most [influential game
designer](http://web.archive.org/web/20020410000000/http://gamespy.com/articles/march02/top30/1813/index.shtm)
ever to grace a pair of dice, appeared to me in a dream. My friend and I
were sitting on a couch discussing the lack of a good *Fallout* sequel,
and suddenly he walked in through the double-doors from my dining room
and started to talk about skill-progression-based RPG development. Gygax
is a kinda old, kinda round, kinda grey-haired smiley dude.

At first I was fascinated -- here, an icon of game development had
arrived in *my dream* to perhaps give me a glimpse -- nay, *a vision* --
into the really heavy kinds of things that people have visions about. He
had a jovial laugh and gesticulated energetically as he explained his
ideas. But then I saw .. his PANTS. He was wearing TIGHT STUDDED LEATHER
PANTS with little DIAMOND STUDS. They squeaked as he talked. I couldn't
really concentrate on what he was saying. I knew that I should listen to
Gary Gygax, I knew that I was supposed to be in the middle of a
life-altering experience, but I just couldn't focus on what he was
saying. I kept ... staring ... at ... his ... pants.

Finally, I just jumped out of my chair and yelled, "Gary, what's with
the PANTS!?" My friend grabbed my arm but it was too late. Gary Gygax's
demeanor completely changed, and his voice boomed out like a wrathful
God. "Be glad I'm wearing pants AT ALL, little man!" Then with a squeak
of tight leather, he turned on his heel and stormed out of my dream. Not
only did I waste a precious opportunity ... I feel a little bit dirty.
