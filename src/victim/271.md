In a [fit of rage](@/victim/264.md) I went over the deep end and *cut
our apartment's DSL connection!* The moment I did so, my roommate -- who
was playing *Day of Defeat* as though Eisenhower had personally
commanded him to do so -- collapsed to the floor in a wailing,
screeching mess. He clawed at his eyes and said he was melting.

I told him he was being a baby and that he was overreacting. I kicked
him out of the way and said, "Since you're done playing, lemme check my
email." Well, I sat down, and then it hit me that I *couldn't* check my
email. I had no Internet connection. My first instinct was to send an
instant message to all of my friends to let them know why I wasn't
online. I clicked on my instant messenger program, but the little
spinning wheel icon indicated it couldn't connect. The true, insidious
horror of this catastrophe finally presented itself to me! I broke out
in a cold sweat and took immediate action. I tried to pinch the DSL
wires together but it was no good. In a panic, I opened my web browser
to go to my ISP's homepage where I could submit a service request. But
the web page wouldn't come up. I was going to have to call their tech
support with a land line. I picked up my phone and turned to my computer
to look up their phone number on their web page ... BUT WAIT! THERE WAS
NO "WORLD-WIDE WEB" IN THIS MAN-MADE HELL ON EARTH!

I slid off the chair onto my knees. "What have I done!" I cried. The
tears began to flow. I was ... a non person! From the floor I grabbed my
roommate's shirt and began shaking him, sobbing. "What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?" I wailed.

By this time he had regained his composure. He straightened up, wiped
his face, and peered down at me with authority. In slow, measured tones,
he spoke: "I ... am going ... to clean the refridgerator." And with that
he stalked off to the kitchen.

...What have we become?
