So there I am, sitting at a grey conference table across from two
gentlemen, one wearing a business suit and the other wearing a "Disco
Sucks" T-shirt. And everything's going great â€” the job interview is
just breezing along. They've had this position open for weeks, and my
skills, as well as my experience as an intern, were a perfect fit. But
then the guy in the suit left for a moment to go get some coffee.

All of a sudden, the dude in the Disco shirt leaned forward and lowered
his voice. He asked me if I ever play Asheron's Call. He asked me if I
was hooked on EverQuest. He asked me if I ever played online roleplaying
games and sold my character for money. I was confused, and I said so.

So then he pulled out this chart, a huge organizational chart that he
had drawn by hand. He explained to me that [for the past year he has
done nothing but play Asheron's Call at work](@/victim/23.md). Then
he pointed to different colored boxes on the org chart and explained
that through [Meticulous career maneuvering](@/victim/41.md) he'd
been slowly weeding out actual employees with people who would also play
games all day.

Finally, he removed a 12-page business plan detailing how, if he
continually replaced key administrative people with hardcore game
addicts, the company could still maintain its current client base using
only two [insomniac tech support guys](@/victim/46.md) and [A couple
clueless cretins in client services](@/victim/79.md). With income
stabilized, he could maintain over 32 employees who did nothing but play
multiplayer RPGs every day. If any problems came up, they could simply
[sell off their characters or valuable items on
e-Bay](@/victim/54.md) for extra income.

Then he asked me, "So are you in or what? Half of middle management and
two VP's are into it already. We've got a whole guild." And of course, I
said, well no, I wasn't really interested, because I only play Windows
Solitaire and I was really hoping to gain some valuable career skills.

He said that was fine, and carefully rolled up his org chart and tucked
it away. For a few minutes we sat in uncomfortable silence. Then,
moments before the other guy returned, he dumped a fish-bowl on my head.

"We can't hire this freak!" he screamed, pointing to my glass head.
"He's wearing our fish bowl!" I tried desperately to answer for myself,
but only burbled water helplessly. I think I swallowed something.

I didn't get the job.
