Well, no, I'm not asking you to take my word for it. Let's just do the
math. We've got 40 people signed up with allegiances to us right now,
and in *Asheron's Call*, that means that all of their experience rolls
up for our characters. It's like the online RPG equivalent of an MLM
scheme. That's a pretty sweet deal.

Now, with just a hundred clones, we could get over *three times* the
experience points. Three times! We'd be leveling up every time we logged
in. That's with just a hundred clones.

But the beauty of clones is that it's easy to crank them out, you know,
get all wu-shu with the cut-n-paste. I've seen it done. So let's say we
up it to one *thousand* clones. At that point, we're nearly the biggest
monarchy in the game. More importantly, we can equip them in identical
armor, each and every one marching in unison, a slave to our slightest
of whims. "Clear out that dungeon, clone army." "Camp that Lugian nest,
clone army." "Sell stuff on eBay, clone army." Open your minds!

Good, good. I can see we're all starting to really think this thing
through. Let me leave you with one parting thought … I'm just planting
the seed here … everyone listening? That's right. *Ten thousand* clones.
You wouldn't be able to take a bathroom break without leveling up.
That's all I'm sayin'.
