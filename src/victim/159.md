Look, I spent two and a half hours last night downloading the Warezed
version of *Black and White* from your 8 gig warez server, and here I
start it up and the damn thing hangs and then crashes. So, I hopped onto
your message board here, and now you're telling me you can't help me get
it working. What kind of Warez server are you? You call this a
"service?" How do you expect my further patronage if you guys give me a
hard time in your message boards, hunh? I might just take my business
elsewhere, or give you a low rating on the top 100 WaReZ List. How would
that feel?

I mean, listen. The fact is, I spent *two hours* downloading this game,
that's a lot of work, so of course I'm entitled to play it. And since I
got it from you guys, don't you think you should maybe *support* the
products you steal for the people who steal them from you?

Yesterday some creep actually suggested I go out and buy it. Who let
that ch0ad on here? Is that the kind of guy you want on your sever?
