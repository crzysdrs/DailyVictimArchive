  Wait — wait — I'm sorry, boys. I missed chapter 16 in the game design doc, the
  one about the blood and gore? Yeah, leave that in. My bad. Cut the rest and throw
  in a few more jumping puzzles to pad it out.

Look look, I know it's tough to scale back, but hey, we need to ship by
the holiday buying season and it's best to get our priorities settled
now, while we still can. "Get our ducks in line," as we used to say when
I sold dish soap, before I got hired as a game producer.

Now then, I think we've settled on the main components of the project on
this white board. But, you game developers are once again trying to do
too much. So we gotta scale back. Less is more. You know. Do a little,
but do it right. Don't spread yourself thin. Chickens and counting them
before the eggs cross the road and break the camel's back and such. You
with me?

So, of this list I made here, everything amounts to higher sales
*except* for the part about the game being fun. That's just not in the
business plan, boys. Nobody has ever proven in a market survey that fun
games necessarily make more money than something with, say, knockers on
the box.

We're selling a total package here, boys, not just something for the
hobbyists. So, we strike the fun, but there's still a lot of good
product here. I think we really narrowed it down to the core elements.
So, I say, lop off the second half of that design document — the one
labelled "gameplay?" and let's focus on that first part, the cutscenes
with Gwyneth Paltrow and the part where we get John Digweed to bust out
the title track. Let's get to work! I smell a hit!
