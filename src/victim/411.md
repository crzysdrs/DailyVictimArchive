  You say you can see why it was rejected? You're fulla crap. You're not one of those
  *pro-Luigi* types, are you?

Yeah, you heard the news, right? Nintendo picked out their [Street
Team](http://web.archive.org/web/20020710000000/http://www.nintendo.com/streetteam/),
dudes who get to [walk around malls with videogames strapped to their
chests](http://web.archive.org/web/20020710000000/http://www.cnn.com/2002/TECH/ptech/07/09/video.game.jobs.ap/index.html)
in order to talk to people about Nintendo games. AND I WASN'T ON THE
TEAM!

That's right, me, rejected. I swear I had that in the bag. You had to
send them an audition tape, and mine was KILLER. Of course I edited it
together on an iMac spliced in with footage from *Apocalypse Now* and
music from Twisted Sister. I shoulda been a shoe-in. You hear me? Shoes
in! Both of 'em!

Where did it all go wrong? That tape was brilliant. I spent ten minutes
setting up the camera angles and lighting. Maybe I shouldn't have worn
the goggles. Or done the whole thing in sepia tones. But I had a KILLER
speech prepared! I talked about how I've been playing games for over a
decade, how I solved the original NES *Bionic Commando* in one marathon
sitting over the course of a weekend pausing only to eat Rice Krispy
treats or pee in a bottle. Maybe they were a little turned off when I
did that interpretive Zelda dance, the one where I wore nothing but
balloons. Did they understand that I blew up and tied those balloons
myself? Or that they *pinched?*

You know what it was? I think it was when I deviated from the script and
went into my Luigi tirade. I started talking about *Mario Party* and
*Mario Kart* and then, without really planning to, I started to riff on
how I saw it as my God-given right, nay, DUTY to drop kick Luigi in the
nuts, just -- just really give him a SHOT to the BOYS, you know what I'm
saying? The guy just has it comin', I'm not afraid to speak the word
when the word is truth man, you know what I'm saying?

To summarize: No Street Team, both shoes in, Luigi's nuts. What am I
missing? Am I missing something here? Maybe we need to make *another
tape*. Get me my camera. And some jelly.
