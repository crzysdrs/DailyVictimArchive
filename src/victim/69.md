We've all seen it -- hell, someone sent me that damn link six times
already. That's the one -- the Chicken head that was found deep fried in
a batch of McDonald's Chicken McNuggets.

You understand that I've been hatching schemes like that -- no pun
intended -- for years! I love nothing more than to have my work
showcased on the Internet. A tip of my hat to the chicken-head, whoever
came up with that one, that was priceless. I haven't had anything of
mine passed around so much since I took that picture of a bunny rabbit
humping a chicken -- you still see that passed around email every
Easter.

But my friend, take a peek at this! That's right -- this little
masterpiece here I call, "Rat in a Coke can." It's my most ambitious
project since I put a band-aid in that batch of french fries. It's gonna
take a few weeks of work, but I'm gonna go big with this.

See, right now, it's just a baby rat. That's how I managed to squeeze
him in there. But I've been feeding him and keeping the Coke can warm at
night, as a wise California Condor would lovingly care for its young.
Soon he will grow big and strong, far too big to have been put into the
can anywhere but the cannery.

Then I'm going to cover him with soda, go into a public place, pretend
to open up the Coke can, and scream, "OH MY GOD THERE'S A RAT IN HERE!"
Wouldn't you know I'll also have a digital camera handy?

This is gonna be great.
