So your saying his incessant screeching is keeping you up at night?
Well, I blame our defense. See, this is a *trained* monkey. He only
squeals whenever someone grabs out flag. Yessir, I'd rather have this
monkey on my team than many of my teammates. But that's not all.

Do you know why he hops up and down? He does that whenever the base is
left unguarded. He knows, because I log him in from my secondary machine
and just have him watch the base from observer mode. Cheating, you say?
Hardly. After all — *he's a monkey*.

Do you know why he makes that chirping sound? I'll tell you — he does
that whenever the Shield Belt or Guard Tech respawn. See, every time I
pick up a rune or powerup, he gets a little piece of banana. Don't you,
Pooj? That's right! That's a good little monkey! He doesn't want to miss
an opportunity.

Know why he opens his mouth and howls? Because Quad Damage is available.
Know why he spins in a circle and makes "ma ma ma" noises? Because
someone's attacking the base. You know why he flings his poo? No, uh,
seriously, do you know why he does that? Because I haven't trained him
to do that, and it's kinda gross.
