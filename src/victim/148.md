Ow - OW! Those bandages are too tight. Yeah, funny that I ended up here
in the clinic again, barely a week after the Mags incident, and so soon
after the beating I took last night. Oh, you weren't here for either?
Last week I [made the mistake of commenting on the size of another
woman's Mags](@/victim/141.md) in front of my wife. No, "Mags." The
little robots that follow you around in [*Phantasy Star
Online*](http://web.archive.org/web/20010317000000/http://www.planetdreamcast.com/games/reviews/phantasystaronline/)
for the Dreamcast. Big mistake.

So anyways, yesterday we were sitting on the couch, passing back and
forth the bottle of Tequila, and I maybe casually might have mentioned,
in passing, that [the farmer chick](/img/dungeonsiege/images/77.png) from
[*Dungeon
Siege*](http://web.archive.org/web/20010317000000/http://gamespy.com/previews/march01/dungeonsiege)
is pretty hot. She was on the cover of a magazine sitting on my coffee
table, wearing armor and holding a flaming sword. I didn't make a big
deal about it or anything. Really, I mean, it was just a barely mumbled
aside. Hardly anything. I guess my exact words were "HOLY CRAP a woman
like that needs to get off of that magazine and on to my face!" and then
I seem to remember loudly making 70s porn music noises with my lips.

Then suddenly I heard the crunch of a skull -- my skull -- and for the
second time in a week the carpet rushed up to greet me. Thank God the
Tequila numbed the pain.

I don't know which is worse though. I mean, Carol was kinda upset that
she knocked me out cold, you know, it was a bit excessive. So she's been
trying to make it up to me. This morning I woke up with a throbbing
headache and she served me breakfast in bed. Which was pretty sweet.
Except she was wearing a suit of medieval armor made of cardboard and
aluminum foil. I didn't quite put two and two together until after I ate
and shuffled into the kitchen. I caught her dumping lighter fluid onto a
sword she'd made out of a yardstick and duct tape.

"Oh honey!" I said, trying to right my wrongs and be a good husband.
"You don't have to dress up like a medieval warrior *Dungeon Siege*
chick for me! I'm sorry about what I said. I love you very much, very
VERY much ... even if your *Phantasy Star Online* character has a
contemptibly small set of Mags."

Yeah, it kinda gets fuzzy from there, you know, as to how she set us
both on fire. Cardboard burns fast. She lit up like a roman candle. So,
here we are! Back at the clinic. But, lemme tell you, I've learned my
lesson: don't comment on videogame chicks or you're gonna get burned.
