  Don't worry, man, it works both ways. If you ever bring a girl up here, I'll be
  sure to run out. I mean, for God's sake, I don't wanna look at *that!*

Okay, while you're busy camping that Banderling nest, it's time you and
I had a little heart-to-heart, roommate-to-roommate chat.

See, it's about this dorm room. Every night you're in here beating up
Asheron's Call bunny rabbits. Ordinarily, that's fine -- it disrupts
neither my studies nor my attempt to achieve the perfect season in
Madden 2001.

However, occasionally I would like to bring a girl back here for what's
typically referred to as "Nookie." I need my privacy, man. I'm like Ling
Ling the Panda over here. I can't breed in public.

See this? It's a signed note from my doctor. I'm getting painful sperm
retention headaches that are going to seriously impact my studies unless
immediate action is taken.

But I've already worked out a plan! Here's the deal -- just leave the
window open a crack. When I pull into the parking lot with a babe in the
Jetta, I'll honk the horn to let you know the situation.

-   **1 short honk:** Likely just some lip-lock, but no reason to quit
    your game
-   **2 short honks:** I'm going to hit at least second base, odds are
    good, you probably have another hour to play
-   **3 short honks:** Save your game as soon as you can, and start
    playing this Sinatra tape before you leave
-   **1 really really long honk:** Dude I'll give you a hundred bucks to
    immediately shut off your computer and clear out PRONTO.

Do we have a deal? Look man, I got *doctor's orders* here. Oh, you can
keep the yellow copy, but I need the pink copy to give to Becky Fisher.
