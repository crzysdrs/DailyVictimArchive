Thaz right, you heard me! Not another peep, not a peep about my
all-nighter last night waitin' for the Necklace of Superiority -- 'cuz I
got it, and that makes me Superior.

So dad, next time you're at tha bank and they ask what your kid does,
you just say, "He's superior." You say, "I've never been so proud of my
Dark Elven Necromancer son."

You tell 'em, "Hot damn, when I left for work yesterday morning, I saw
that my son had been up all night camping the Crypt of Dalnir. Then you
say, when I got home from work yesterday evening he was still camping in
that Got-damned Crypt. He's got that stick-to-it-tiveness, you know,
he's gonna *go places*, that's what you tell 'em.

And you tell mom ta stop givin' me a hard time, because you never know,
I just might move *out* your basement, and then what're you gonna do?
And I'm gonna take that couch that's down there, my couch, and I'm gonna
see if I can find some cushions for it. Then you'll be sorry! You'll
have no couch, and no Dark Elven son necromancin' in your basement, and
it'll be just like all that empty nest stuff you see on TV, in those
long distance commercials, it'll be all sad. So like, knock it off and
stuff.
