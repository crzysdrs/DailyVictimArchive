Hey kiddies! You want to know my secret? The way that I've won every
tournament at every single computer gaming LAN party I've ever hosted at
my house since late '97? Let me tell you, it's not the skillz. It's *The
Sauce.*

Tha's right. No Saturday afternoon of gaming goodness is complete
without a barbecue, and no burger leaves this here grill without a
helathy dose of *The Sauce.* I pile it on there, three layers thick.
That's after marinating the meat in it overnight. Friday evening my
wife's like, "What are you doin' down there?"

I'm Makin' *Sauce.*

In order to distill properly it helps to start makin' *The Sauce* well
in advance of the party in question. Since you never know when a good
weekend is gonna crop up, it's best to have some *Sauce* on hand at all
times. You could get lucky. I always got some *Sauce* to whip out when
it counts. That's my other word of advice to you kids: When you're not
actually partying it up, you should be whippin' up some *Sauce*, even
alone if you have to.

Sometimes you'll get the occasional assclown who's like, "oh no, no
*sauce* for me!" Hah, what a jagoff. When he's not lookin', he gets an
extra squirt of the good stuff. Hah hah. That burning in your tonsils?
That's the taste of victory, kids. Don't forget it.
