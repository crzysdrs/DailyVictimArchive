  I dunno about The Rock, but earlier "Stone Cold" Steve Austin showed up and asked
  where the pr0n was happening. \*sigh\*

You might be asking yourself why I’m hiding in this locker. It started
this morning when I [inadvertently distributed leaflets inviting my high
school to the "2002 Senior Pr0n."](@/victim/340.md) Never before in
the history of the high school endeavor have so many owed so many
hard-ons to so small a typo.

Now that the Citizens for Decency committee is picketing the school and
Ron Jeremy was just awarded an honorary diploma, things are about to
erupt into full-scale rioting. The rest of the crew at the High School
Literary Magazine have started calling me "Barely Legal" Ted.

Well, it's times like this that try the teenage soul. Moments like these
are when I ask myself: What would The Rock do? I’m serious. Let's think
about this. Would I bust out of this locker, throw two knives at once,
and simultaneously kill two sword-wielding guys in turbans? Maybe I’d
kidnap some half-naked sorceress. Would I step into the ring, arch an
eyebrow, and trash talk the Undertaker?

Basically, what I’m saying is, if I were to cook something, *what would
it smell like?*
