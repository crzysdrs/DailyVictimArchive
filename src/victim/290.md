Yes sir!

These modern first person shooters are the pinnacle of realism, and
they're turning me into a combat *machine*. I'm not saying I'm eager for
us Canadians to get into an armed conflict with any of the destablizing
influences around the world, but suffice it to say, I'll be *ready* if
my country needs me!

For instance, many people would be balked by the presence of a locked
front door to a secret warehouse. Me? Never! My highly-trained soldier
instincts tell me there's probably a back door, or maybe a window that
can only be reached by jumping up and down onto a bunch of crates. Few
civilians would think to do it, and experience has shown me that the
enemy *never* expects it!

Sometimes you'll find a large crate next to a wall that's too high to
jump over. But, you can't jump up on the large crate, either. Ordinary
soldiers would break down weeping at the site of this. They may even
talk about going back to Canada. Not me. I'm a walking combat inferno.
*I* know to push a smaller, movable crate next to the bigger crate, so
then I can jump up on them both.

It's true. I lead a dangerous double life.

Now then, I see I've gotten my next briefing. I've got to flip a switch
on the other end of the level. They're sending me in alone, of course,
but as soon as I flip the lever I'm sure the colonel will appear with my
next assignment. *Take that, you Communist or otherwise
undemocratically-aligned terrorist fundamentalist organization of
ill-defined national origin!*

I pity the government that messes with me.
