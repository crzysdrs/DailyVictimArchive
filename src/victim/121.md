  Actually, we should just start randomly flinging satellites everywhere, you know,
  just landing them at random. Maybe put webcams on all of them. That would rock.

Consider this a public address to those peeps at NASA: That's right,
stop playing around with your erotic chunks of stone a few million miles
away and pay more attention to the problems here on Earth, specifically,
with an FTP mirror somewhere near my house!

You saw the news -- they took a robot probe that was just supposed to
take pictures of a rock from orbit and, on a whim, they fired off some
retro-thrusters or something and actually landed on it. They landed on
it. That's like dropping a videocamera (sans tripod) off of a building
and having it send you back video after it lands. Except, imagine that
the video camera cost a few hundred million dollars, and the building
was 196 million miles tall. Now, imagine for a second that you've been
sitting here 40 minutes waiting for a 125 megabyte file to download from
a fileserver that can't be more than 25 miles away. I think we can all
agree that our priorities are messed up.

That's right NASA: if you wanna gather some useful information from the
stars, why not have your zillion dollar satellites beam me back MY
FRICKING GAME DEMO? And furthermore, you jackoffs at -- whoa, wait a
second, it just finished downloading.

Okay, sorry about that NASA, you, uh, keep on doing that thing with the
rocks and the spaceships and stuff. I didn't mean to get so testy.
