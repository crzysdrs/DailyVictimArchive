  I swear, I had some jelly under here. No, not in the jar ... but on a leash.

Wow look at you! You’re home early! Oh yeah, dinner plans, we were gonna
go out to Valentine’s dinner and why you ask, why aren’t I dressed? Why
am I playing *Metroid?* What’s wrong with the TV? Nothing’s wrong,
sweetie-lumpkins, I turned it upside down. I totally forgot about our
Valentine’s dinner plans but let me answer your question with one of my
own:

Didja ever smoke a Chia-Pet?

Let me tell YOU, it’s the gift that keeps on giving! I don’t know how
long it took you to grow that ... lamb ... sheep ... chia ... thing, but
WOW, one big puff and it’s time to call the WHAMbulance!

I’d never been able to get past the third level of *Metroid* before, but
look at me now! The secret was to unplug the controller! And overturn
the TV! Is that even *Metroid* anymore? I can’t tell! It’s hard to see
from inside my pillow-fort. Do you think I can bring it with me to the
restaurant? Honey? Honey?
