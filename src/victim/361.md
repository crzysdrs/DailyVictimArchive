  Alas, Mr. Pickles. The fur I've ruffled time and time again. Will I ever look in
  your eyes and see the Mr. Pickles I know and love staring back at me?

When Mr. Pickles was a kitten, my fiance Leah would always torment him
with one of those laser pointers. These days, however, his kitten-like
playfulness has mutated into an all-encompassing obsession with my new
Microsoft Optical mouse. The attacks began in earnest shortly after it
was out of the shrink wrap. Something about that darting red light, I
guess. It drove Mr. Pickles paw-first into that abyss that lurks
somewhere between Friskies and madness.

He leapt from the bookshelf in a blinding arc of fur, pouncing onto the
peripheral in the midst of a furious game of *Soldier of Fortune*. That
was just the beginning. It has since encompassed all nine of his lives.

After three years of teetering on the precipice, It's safe to say that
Mr. Pickles no longer walks among the self-controlled. He's in that same
dark place where the catnip junkies prowl about and howl at the moon.
There's no getting through to Mr. Pickles anymore. However, if I wriggle
his head, I find I pretty much have just as much control over my game as
before. My *Soldier of Fortune II* skillz continue relatively
unhindered, but it's Mr. Pickles who paid the ultimate price... with his
*soul*.
