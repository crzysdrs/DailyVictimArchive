blurb: >
  Did you ever see the movie "The Natural?" Well, I'm going to make a movie about
  Biceps Slughausen called "The Unnatural." He's going to knock the cover off of the
  bat.

  players, my team consists of five mutants.

I never play through any baseball videogames with any of the licensed
MLB teams. What, play with nine mediocre players with a mix of skills?
What fun is that? I can barely tell them apart. Whoopie, so one guy’s
got a .375 batting average. That’s nothing. If you create your own
player and crank his batting stat up at the expense of everything else,
you can get an average of .650.

That’s assuming that you don’t face my pitcher who can throw a fastball
at 298 MPH.

Yessir, by juggling the stats around a little, I found that a
nine-player team was kinda redundant. If you have that many guys on the
field, of *course* the ball is going to land on one of them. No sir, I
can make do with a team of five.

Five *mutants.*

This guy over here, named Limby Two-Toes, he plays first and second
base. And back there is “Legs” McNelly. He’s my only outfielder. Guy can
sprint faster than a bullet train and he can catch ANYTHING. But he
can’t throw. Instead, he runs to the infield and uses his stumpy arms to
lob the ball toward Bill “Rocket Wrist” McBallchuck, who fires that
sucker over to whichever of my two basemen makes the most sense.

It’s never a very high scoring game, since nobody on my team is capable
of both running AND hitting the ball. No, I just rely on Brandon
“Biceps” Slughausen -- my wheelchair-bound star hitter -- to knock one
out of the park. Then I have my one-legged pitcher “accidentally” chuck
a few fastballs at the kneecaps of the opposing team, and before long my
misfits are waving the pennant after yet another 1-0 victory.

God bless this all-American sport.
