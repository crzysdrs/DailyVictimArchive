  Advance? It may not fit in your pocket, but that's okay, 'cuz the prototype de-pantsed

Attention friend — THIS IS NOT SPAM!

How would you like to have the BODY OF YOUR DREAMS without fad diets,
pills, or stressful and time-consuming exercise programs? I didn't
believe it was true until I tried it for myself. Yes, thanks to the
200-pound mouse and three games of WarCraft a week, I've gained over 56
pounds of muscle mass!

It's such a simple idea but IT WORKS! For real! Our SPECIALLY DESIGNED
ERGONOMIC COMPUTER MICE are filled with sand and then dipped in solid
lead. Sure, they may be eight inches wide and nearly impossible to move
with one hand, but that's why they've had PROVEN EFFECTIVENESS at
building upper arm strength in just 30 days or less.

Kylie Anderson, 25, of Jackson, Maine build up enough muscle with the
200 pound mouse to BENCHPRESS AN XBOX.

Still not convinced? Talk to Joe Kreider, 22, of Philmore, Indiana. In
just two weeks of intensive deathmatching that his spine snapped under
the grotesque weight of his forklift-like forearms.

After just 30 days with the 200-pound mouse, now whenever I use a
normal-sized mouse I put it through the wall without thinking.

Act now and receive a special free Kevlar mousemat.
