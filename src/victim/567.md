I’d like to gather everyone together to publicly rebut the claim made in
[yesterday’s Daily Victim](@/victim/566.md) that my *EverQuest*
guild, Archon’s Minions, faked the slaying of Lord Nagafen the Fire
Dragon.

First of all, let’s be realistic: Why would a guild as powerful as ours
go through the expense of faking a Dragon Slaying? Let’s be sure to put
these crackpot conspiracy theorists in their place!

Now let’s address his preposterous claims one-by-one. Fact: Although the
slaying took place on November 16th, the images were uploaded to our
website from the various participants over the course of the next few
days. Most were re-sized for the web, causing their file modification
dates to be altered; hence the discrepancy.

You’ll also note that Bloodsaage the Warrior from our guild plays from a
different time zone than Keela the Cleric. If we adjust for the time
differences, his screenshot was actually taken at 5:38 PM, 16 minutes
*after* Keela’s screenshot of BainDramage the Dwarf coming in and
introducing himself. So there’s nothing out of the ordinary in those
images -- Another piece of “evidence,” obliterated in the face of cold
hard facts!

Thirdly, let’s talk about the shadow placement that my esteemed accuser
makes such a big deal out of. Note that Whizzbenger the Cleric is
enjoying the benefits of a *Levitation spell!* This explains the unusual
positioning of the shadows in the screenshots.

Now then, lastly, I’d like to offer incontrovertible evidence that we
did, in fact, slay Lord Nagafen the Dragon. BEHOLD! THE BLADESTOPPER
SHIELD! Only Naggy drops this, hence, Archon’s Minions *had* to kill the
dragon. What does your guild have to say about THAT?

**THAT’S VERY CLEVER, VERY CLEVER INDEED ... BUT HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN
*THIS* EBAY AUCTION RESULTS PAGE?**  
 According to this archived page my committee dug up, just two weeks ago
a Bladestopper Shield was sold to Ebay account “a\_minion” for an
undisclosed price. I contacted the seller and discovered that the item
was in fact sold in exchange for ... [a HUMAN
BABY!!](@/victim/284.md)
{% end %}

Now, according to your Guild’s message board, one of your members
recently *had* a baby. That was a month and a half ago. Then, two weeks
ago, all mentions of the new baby suddenly and inexplicably ceased. What
I’m getting at, my good Minion of Archon, is this: we’ll all believe
your Dragon-Killing story ... IF YOU CAN SHOW US THE BABY.

{% css_class(class="left clear") %}
[![](/img/victimpics/mar03/realdragonslay.gif)](@/victim/567.md) **UH
.... THAT BABY UH .... HE UH, HE HAS A COLD RIGHT NOW... HE CAN’T COME
TO THE WEBCAM, OTHERWISE I’D SHOW YOU ... THE BABY. LOOK I HAVE TO GO.**
