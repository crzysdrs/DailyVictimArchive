I can understand, maybe even appreciate your freakish delight in [*Super
Monkey
Ball*](http://web.archive.org/web/20020807000000/http://www.gamespy.com/previews/august02/smb2/),
but let me explain a few key differences between the video game and what
you're proposing to do with Marty the family Guinea Pig.

First of all, kids, let me tell you something about Monkeys. They're
crazy little schmucks, all of 'em. They probably love being shoved
inside of balls and rolled down, say, staircases or driveways decorated
with cinder-block obstacles. Hell, kids, I'd say they live for it. You
find me a monkey, I'll *make* you a ball. That's right.

But Guinea Pigs are gentler animals. Do you know why that is, kids?
Because, in the animal kingdom, Guinea Pigs are known as "food." So, the
idea of being in a clear plastic bubble is, in their eyes, not that
different from sitting in the business end of a salad bar. Furthermore,
they don't have flexible limbs capable of maneuvering the proposed Super
Guinea Pig Ball. I guarantee Marty would just sorta flail around until
he got lodged under the mini-van.

In short? The only balls Marty's ever going to have in this house are
the two that God gave 'em. Now go back and play Nintendo.
