  And you know another thing? The other night I was playing Age of Empires against
  the computer, and I swear -- no no, seriously -- I swear one of those Mongol villager
  chicks was putting the moves on me. Somethin' to think about, there.

So three of us set up this game of StarCraft over the net, right? And we
all agree in the chat room that it's a free-for-all. Now, no more than
five minutes into it, these two clowns are pounding my Protoss butt into
the dirt from both ends. I can't help but think there was something to
this.

You know, I've been thinking about it all week, and all those little
hints and mannerisms ... they're all coming back to me. Like, when they
were levelling my Cybernetics Core? One of his little space marines was
looking at his buddy's Hydralisk in sorta a familiar way. It's like
this, right? -- Space marines don't be associating with no Hydralisks
unless there's a little action on the side, at least as I see it.

Now hang on, don't get me wrong, I mean, there's nothing wrong with
however anyone wants to swing their thing. That's none of my business.
I'm just saying that interpersonal relationships -- that's all fine --
but it can't be brought into the game like that. I like to keep things
separate. Got my Zerg here ... got my booty over there ... dig?

I'm just sayin'.
