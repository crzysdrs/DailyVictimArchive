Actually, I don't care what you play, but I guarantee it could be
improved with a skillfully application of good ol' fashioned
*nappy-time*. I'm a Capture-the-Flag fan, myself. Once a server gets
rumbling, there's really no reason to leave. Like Thomas Edison
cat-napping in his lab, I find I can go indefinitely with just a nod-off
whenever I get the opportunity. Let's say someone shoots me with a
rocket; My head hits the keyboard even before my body hits the ground.

Some people claim that computer chairs are inherently uncomfortable for
sleeping. I don't buy it. Look at the extra padding right here -- and
here. And here I can adjust this so that I can lean waaay back. It's
perfect. So, say someone frags me. I throw my weight backwards and sling
my head back like so: nyarrggh. You'll note that the chair is springy,
and it flings my weight forward immediately -- I catch about a second's
worth of slumber before my character respawns, at which point I'm back
upright in one smooth motion. The rest I get is incredible. Sometimes I
snore.

Okay, now let's say the map changes. I have roughly seven, maybe eight
seconds of blissful slumber before the next map kicks off. That's where
you really make up for lost time; in-between levels. Often I'll dream.
Whoa, hang on, the map just changed! \*\*--ssnnnrrgkkk\*\*--
