  too late now. I'm just saying.

  a "Casemod" in the classical sense

I normally think of casemods as, well, like carving holes in your
computer case and putting funky red lights inside and stuff. Like the
guy who had the eerie green glow coming from all the air vents and the
alien faces airbrushed on the outside of his PC. Or that one guy who
built a computer out of a bong. Or maybe he made his computer INTO a
bong. Maybe he was just smoking a bong. Maybe that was me. I'm a little
fuzzy on the details.

But one thing I'm clear about: stuffing [that new Radeon
card](https://web.archive.org/web/20031003000000/http://www.gamespy.com/hardware/october03/radeon/)
down your pants and hooking it up really doesn't count as a "casemod."

Sure, it's stimulating. I'll give you that.

But a casemod? How do you SIT with that thing in there anyways? And the
wires? And what if you need to go to the bathroom? Isn't it hot in
there? What?

Hey, WHOA. Okay, the words "Liquid Cooled" do not belong in a
conversation about pants. Let's just take a time out, okay?
