  This doesn't have anything to do with the 25% stake that the ZipCo fish oil company
  had in PrizeWire, does it?

Pardon the all-staff mailing, but I'd like to address the recent Salmon
Jerky problem. Matters were brought to a head this morning when I
reached into the bowl of M&Ms on Jenn's desk, and discovered that buried
under a thin layer of chocolatey goodness was nothing but handful after
handful of Salmon Jerky. I'm not fooled, and I don't think our
shareholders are, either.

I first noticed the problem shortly after we acquired
[PrizeWire.com](@/victim/20.md). That week you recall we unloaded an
enormous moving truck full of big brown cartons from them, storing the
boxes throughout the first floor. I, personally, opened the first carton
off of the truck and verified that it was a desktop PC. I assumed the
others were. However, it has come to my attention that the first box was
merely a feint, and it is my belief that the giant truck was filled
almost exclusively with Salmon Jerky â€” even to the point of stuffing
the glove compartment.

Last week, when the "revised" employee orientation packets were passed
out to the entire staff? I noted that they were the exact same packets
as last year, except this time there was a bag of Salmon Jerky stapled
to each and every one.

When I ordered sandwiches for the weekly accounting staff meeting, I
discovered that our regular potato chips had been substituted with a
two-foot-high mound of Salmon Jerky that had been warmed in the
microwave.

Two days ago I retrieved my leftover lunch from the fridge only to
discover that someone had opened the container and added chopped Salmon
Jerky to my potato salad.

Yesterday I saw Janet slowly feeding Salmon Jerky to Crenshaw while he
slept at his desk.

This morning there were chunks of something foreign floating in my
coffee. That's right. Salmon Jerky. Big rubbery chunks. Floating. In my
coffee.

Is there something about this acquisition that you're not telling us?
