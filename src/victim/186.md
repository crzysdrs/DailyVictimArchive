That's right, citizens, I have a fiber-optic cable linking my machine to
the server that it rests on top of. Step aside, step aside, latent ones!
Now, it has come to my attention that foul-intentioned individuals have
*taken* our *flag*. I don't appreciate that kind of behavior and I
certainly won't go out of my way to tolerate it on a server on which I
contain nearly Godlike powers.

Watch and grovel before me as I rail the opposition out of mid air. I
only killed him alone because he happened to have the flag — normally I
conserve my ammo and wait until two or more opponents are lined up in a
row before firing, killing them all simultaneously.

I will now jump and snag the flag as it falls from mid-air. For you
modeming mortals this would take split-second timing, but for me, the
entire server feels like the slow-motion shots of the *Matrix* movie.

Note that as I return the flag, my ping sometimes actually drops into
negative numbers. That's right. The server often fires my gun *BEFORE* I
even push the mouse button. Behold. Sometimes, merely by walking into a
room, everyone on the other team spontaneously dies. You might think
that's unfair, but I merely call it superior server-side prediction
code.

Well, latent citizens, my work here is done. Call me again should you
need me, although, by the time I recieve your pathetically slow missive,
I'll probably have already have solved the problem. Farewell!
