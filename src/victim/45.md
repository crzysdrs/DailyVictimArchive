Boy, when I bought my new Dreamcast, never could I have guessed the
culinary delights that would await. For example, I just had a second
helping of that new fish-game, "Seaman." Even though I used up all my
tartar sauce on Ecco the Dolphin, and I'm not normally a fan of sea
food, all I can say is hot damn! Hey, whoa, wait — who are you? What
are you doing here?

**Fargo:** *I'm sorry ladies and gentlemen, this is Fargo, the author of
the piece, and I would like to apologize for what you are now reading.
See, once Gabe drew me a picture of a guy eating a Dreamcast, I could
not, for the life of me, get the headline "SEAMAN IS DAMN TASTY!" out of
my head. I knew that the double-entendre was morally reprehensible,
juvenile, weak, unwarranted, disgusting, and that my mother simply
raised me better.*

*And yet, I have the mind of a small child.*

*Once I had the headline in my head, I simply couldn't write anything
else. I tried. At one point I actually typed, "HELLO, I HAVE A DREAMCAST
IN MY MOUTH." But I had to delete it. No, once I thought of the SEAMAN
headline, I knew it had to be posted. The depravity must be made public.
I knew I would post it despite the fact that hardly anyone has heard of
[the
Game](https://web.archive.org/web/20001110000000/http://planetdreamcast.com/games/reviews/seaman/).
I knew I would post it despite the fact that on the whole you guys
prefer the PC victims to the console ones. I knew I would post it even
though my mother would read this.*

*In short, up yours! I am driven by forces that I alone cannot
comprehend. You're either with me or against me on this one, but for
God's sake just don't stand idly by, get down their to those radio
buttons and VOTE THIS YOUNG MAN TO HELL.*

*Oh yeah, and [Read this
Comic](https://web.archive.org/web/20001110000000/http://www.gamespy.com/comics/november00/angst9/).*

*Thank you.*
