For months, [me and my roommates were addicted to Nintendo’s *Animal
Crossing*](@/victim/477.md). We fought for the biggest houses and the
coolest furniture. Dennis had built a whole boxing ring in his basement
and I had an Apollo moon-landing reenactment built in my attic.

*Animal Crossing* is billed as the game that plays even when you’re
away. It operates on a real 24-hour clock, and simulates seasons
throughout the course of the year. But, you know how it is with games.
One week *Animal Crossing* is absorbing every moment of your life, and
the next thing you know, you and your roommates all get the
*Battlefield* expansion. And then it’s *Metroid Prime*. Pretty soon,
you’re playing *Legend of Zelda* 24/7, and it’s been months since you
paid attention to the
[animals](http://web.archive.org/web/20030403000000/http://gamespy.com/fargo/september02/animalcrossing/).

But me, I decided to go back and check in on the little guys inside the
game. I figured their economy would be doing great after all that fruit
I planted, and Nook’s big department store would have by now attracted a
whole commercial downtown district. Come to think of it, it was kinda
exciting. I plugged in the game, fired up the GameCube, and signed in.

It was a bad sign during the login process when Anchovy the bird
appeared, missing an eye, and asked me to spot him five bells for his
“medication.” Once I got into town things got worse. So far as I could
tell Biscuit the puppy and Biff the hippo had been living on the train
for the last six months. The seats were torn and there was graffiti all
over the walls.

When I stepped out, I saw just beside the station the boarded up burned
out remains of Nook’s shop. I walked on until I found the neighborhood
where I used to live. The paint had long since peeled off my old house
and it was surrounded by weeds -- the only way I could tell it was mine
was because it still had [a wiener painted on my
door](@/victim/474.md). I found the mayor’s body in my basement and
Peewee the Gorilla living inside the moon lander in the attic. The rest
of my furniture had either been stolen or burned for warmth last winter.

When I got outside, somebody shot me for wearing an 8-ball tee-shirt.
