  Now, here's a rough draft of something else I've been working on. See, when the
  kitty-cat sneezes, it'll cause the headcrab to scurry down this corridor, triggering
  off the bowling ball, which will roll down and hit this zippo lighter, which will
  burn through this string......

I'm talking about *Half-Life 2*. I know the release date isn't even
close, but it's never too early to prepare yourself for a game where
objects will react and interact with one another with force and
velocity. PHYSICS, my friend. It's all about the PHYSICS.

Take a look at my diagrams here. The weight and mass of the objects was
roughly calculated by watching the [*Half-Life 2*
Movie](http://web.archive.org/web/20030917000000/http://www.fileplanet.com/files/120000/123983.shtml)
over and over again. Obviously, the trajectory equations were all based
off of Newton's laws.

As you can see, the day the game comes out, I plan on dropping this
front half of a demolished car onto a two-by-four balanced across this
overturned barrel. I, of course, will be standing on the other half of
the plank. I figure I can reach a height of over 200 meters.

Now, in this chart here, I've taken an overturned metal table and rigged
explosives onto the underside, set off by this tripwire here. Because of
the force generated and the nearby wall here, I believe I can rocket
this table down an enclosed hallway at about 30 meters/second. Let's see
what the combine thinks of THAT!

Of course, what would really help me is if I could attach ropes to
things. If so, as you can see by my final chart, I could build a
trebuchet capable of launching a soda machine with enough force to plow
through 12 inches of concrete.

Not to fear, though. This, and more, will be possible once I code and
release my *McGuyver* mod. Also, Gordon will have a mullet.
