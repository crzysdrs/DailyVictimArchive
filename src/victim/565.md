Hello Fargo and Hot Soup (hereinafter referred to as “Parties of the
First Part,”) I have a great [suggestion](mailto:feedback@gamespy.com)
for the Daily Victim, as requested by your web site (enclosed and tagged
as exhibit A.)

However, use of my idea will be considered binding with regards to the
digital rights information which I’ve enclosed. I ask that the original
idea be used in whole with no un-approved alterations herewith. My name
shall be retained with the original submission and posted forthwith in
accompaniment of the unaltered submission as follows: “Copyright ©
2002-2003 Alfonso Gardeazabal All Rights Reserved. This Victim and
associated text cannot be reproduced without written permission of the
author and must retain this disclaimer in all reproductions herewith.”

The disclaimer is to be accompanied by the enclosed digital replica of
my signature, as well as this picture of a hot bouncing anime babe that
I use in the forums. I respectfully await your earliest reply.
Sincerely, A. Gardeazabal.

\[Daily Victim idea [submitted](mailto:feedback@gamespy.com) by GameSpy
reader Alfonso Gardeazabal. Actually, that wasn’t his idea. I can’t
remember what his idea was, but it seriously came with a long legal
disclaimer, which I thought was funnier than the idea. Thank you,
Alfonso.\]
