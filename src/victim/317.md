So, you remember [my 'unbeatable' *Empire Earth*
scenario?](@/victim/309.md) Yeah, no sooner do I release it to the
net, than some guy writes me an email twenty minutes later saying it was
way too easy. What a jerk! But, instead of getting all pissed off, I
email him back and asked his advice. Lemme tell you, even though some
people are real jerks over the Internet, sometimes you can find some
pretty sharp guys out there. I mean, this dude was like an *Empire
Earth* God or something. He let me in on a few tricks of the trade.

My *new* scenario? It’s like divinely inspired. When I hit the “load”
button, this screen will fill with a heavenly light. That guy on the
Internet was *good*. I wonder what he does for a living?

![](/img/victimpics/mar02/colorgod.png)**SO I TELLS THE GUY, “YOU CAN’T JUST SLAP A WORLD TOGETHER”**  
 You gotta allow yourself about six days just to build the map, right?
Then, I like to take a break. You know. Rest for a day. Afterwards, you
begin what I like to call “the long beta test.” You can’t rush this. I
didn’t build Rome in a day. Sometimes, if you don’t like what you’ve
done, you’ve got to be willing to just flood the whole map with water
and start over. Hey, you gotta do what you gotta do.
