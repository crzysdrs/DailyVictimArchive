  It's important for some of you chumps to vote for the high numbers, and some of
  you chumps to vote for the low numbers. I'll guard the undefended middle. I can
  do that because I'VE BEEN DEFENDING THIS BASE SINCE THEY CANCELLED THE JEFFERSONS!

Look here, chumpy! This flag, this base, this turf is MINE, you
understand? I've been defending this very flag since before you even
installed Windows. I've been defending this flag since before daylight
savings time. You know when they invented luggage wheels? I don't,
either, but I can say almost with certainty that whenever they did I was
still defending this damn flag. So listen up!

I own this base, see? When new rockets spawn in, you must wait at LEAST
four seconds before you pick them up. After four seconds, you can be
assured that I left them there intentionally for my teammates and didn't
need them for myself. How can you know for sure? Because I know when ALL
the rockets in this base will spawn, and I time each and every one! How
can I do that?

Because I've been defending this base since before the Falkland Islands
War!

When you hear a splash, you will ignore the pool in the back of the base
and instead guard the front door. This is known as covering my back.
I'll kill the jerk coming through the water entrance, because I have
sighted each and every square inch of this base and will shoot him
before he even emerges from his watery stinkhole.

I can do so because I've been guarding this flag since Carson was still
on the Tonight Show.

The fact is, I have never even SEEN the enemy base. I assume that such a
structure exists. I have heard the other players talk about it. There is
ancillary evidence available to corroborate the existance of an enemy
stronghold, in the fact that enemy flags are occasionally brought to our
base, presumably from a similar enemy structure. Also the enemy seems to
continually appear, I can only assume from a home of their own. But the
existence, or lack of, an enemy base does not concern me. Because this
base is my base, and you are in MY HOUSE.

You do not so much as wipe your ass in the presence of my base unless
you ask and I respond with the "affirmative" chat shortcut that I have
had bound to my 'H' key since Nixon was president. Have I made myself
clear?
