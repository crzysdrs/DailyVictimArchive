Hold, scoundrel! Again ye gnarled hands twist and manipulate the stock
prices of my noble enterprise, and ye act as though clicking on mine
glass-dome stock ticker icon does not reveal ye treachery!

Pay heed, robber barrons! The chains of *mine* railroad empire are nobly
forged through the blood and sweat of Chinamen, not the ruthless
money-mongering of ye vile stock market recriminations! Even now the
cowtowns of the West praise the name Talmadge Fisk, raising glasses to
me in celebration of the transcontinental railroad that I finished 'ere
the tenth turn was done.

Unhand mine public shares lest I correspond with the newspapermen and
expose ye insidious machinations before the public. Were we on a LAN,
explosive fisticuffs would assuredly ensue!
