Hello, user.

I understand you've been running a Tribes server on company hardware,
clearly violating our fine Corporation's acceptable use policy.

May I remind you that I am in possession of a set of RAZOR SHARP BEAVER
TEETH?

That's right, simple employee. All it takes is one good gnaw and your
entire ethernet collapses about your head like a house of cards. You are
at my mercy!

Recall, if you will, my encounter with Schmitt, our former IT Director.
He attempted to withstand my imminent seizure of power using his rough
metallic snake of retribution -- but it was no match for my razor sharp
beaver teeth.

Now I am the Alpha Techie. Your position in this corporation is
dependant upon the fragile whims of my gnashing Beaver Teeth. I suggest
you respect their authority.
