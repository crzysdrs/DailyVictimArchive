  Look at this: That's right. It's a genuine 200-sided die. You can't get this anywhere
  else. It takes about five mintutes to stop rolling.

Yes, I'm talking to [this punk](@/victim/687.md), the moron shedding
tears over the closing of one tentacle of the massive Hasbro corporate
oligarchy. So what! Wizards of the Coast stores are closing. Big deal:

Maybe — and this is going to sound all kinds of crazy — you should
just clap your yapper and support your local hobby store, toadlick.
We've been here all along.

I'm tournament master for "The Gaming Hole," down on the skeezy side of
Poplar Street. We represent everything that a small game shop stands
for!

We've got all the big board games, the mainstream stuff, as well as the
stuff you can hardly find anymore like old modules for Advanced Squad
Leader and a bunch of other discontinued stuff. Plus, we don't push one
manufacturer's games over any other, because we're not owned by any
deep-pocketed corporate scuzballs. If we were, we could afford to fix
the roof so damp ceiling tiles wouldn't keep plummeting into our
Normandy Diorama.

You should stop by sometime, so all of us can suddenly fall silent and
stare awkwardly at the stranger. Then we'll comment aloud on every box
you pick up until you leave.
