Hello again, low-bandwidth.

Many of you were apparently pleased by my recent white paper on attempts
to [Overclock My Own DNA](@/victim/13.md) in order to achieve better
frag counts at Unreal Tournament or Counter-Strike. Your support of my
work has not gone unnoticed! As you can see by my frantic, unnecessarily
complex gesticulation, I've been overclocked for over a week now and I
love it! You can never get too many frames per second. Note that as I
move across the room, to your underpowered eyes with their slow refresh
rate I appear to jerk and stumble spasmodically — but from my own
perception every move I make is smooth as silk as well as an intense
sexual turn-on!

That's not to say that my performance in multiplayer action games is to
be ignored. I can finish a ten minute Quake deathmatch in 2.26 minutes,
every time. I am also capable of urinating a distance of over 448
meters.

But with my newfound powers comes also a growing sense of isolation.
What good, I ask you, are my super-human abilities and perceptions
without another creature to share them with? Recently I tried to
overclock my pet puppy and he was sadly killed while eating the tires
off of a moving bus. Thus began my search for human companionship — and
that's when I found *her*.

Night after night I began to take note of her in the computer labs. She
sat there, motionless, playing Capture the Flag with the steely eyed
gaze of a woman with a purpose. What does she major in? How does she
sustain herself? How long had she sat, [defending her own
base](@/victim/17.md), showing no interest in the base of the enemy?
From across the room I stared at her for five hours last night (it only
took me two.) I was in love.

But this morning I approached her and suggested that she and I go up to
my place where I can strap her to a table and overclock her. Her
reaction, surprisingly, was one of terror and disgust. Sure, I am half
her age, but I will easily be double that in a quarter of the time.
There must be a way!

Meanwhile, I'm going to overclock Baldur's Gate II to see if I can get a
level 77 mage.
