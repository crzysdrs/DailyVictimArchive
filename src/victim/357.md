  game comes out with a Boba Fett mod.

With some games, it can be months before people figure out how to create
a Boba Fett skin for the main character. Months! No sir, why would I
want to waste my flavor on THAT? Look here, I'm a busy guy.

That's why I'm stoked about
[Morrowind](http://web.archive.org/web/20020502000000/http://gamespy.com/previews/march02/morrowind/).
Did you see this morning on [The Morrowind Summit
Fansite](http://web.archive.org/web/20020502000000/http://www.rpgplanet.com/morrowind/)
that somebody ALREADY added Boba Fett armor to the game? As far as I
know, the game isn't even on shelves yet, and already IT'S GOT BOBA.
That's what I'm talking about. The quicker the Boba, the better the
game.

Now step aside, I've got a game to buy.
