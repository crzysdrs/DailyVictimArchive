I'm sorry, no, you can't have my email address. Why? Because you suck at
*Tribes 2*.

I'm a girl of discriminating tastes, and I would prefer not to waste my
time with the type of jerk who builds a Havoc transport and then doesn't
announce via the radio commands that it's ready. Lips that don't touch
team chat will never touch mine.

Then I watched you fly your transport overhead with two empty seats.
What does that tell me? That tells me you're a man who can't take his
time, who rushes through a job just to finish half-ass. I have to ask
myself, what kind of kisser would that man be? What kind of date would
he be? How would he be in bed? As short as his flag run? I think we all
know what the answer is.

My kinda man plays with team damage on, because he's got the sensitive
touch.

When a woman mines a flag, she expects a man on her own team not to keep
running over it. You probably don't put the seat down, either. And
what's with the inventory station you built facing the wrong way under a
bridge BEHIND our base? You probably don't ask for directions when
you're driving. Speaking of which, judging by the way you handled that
Shrike fighter before crashing it into a mountain, I'm going to guess
you drive a car with a mismatched fender and a primer-colored hood.

My kinda man can snipe a scout outta mid air with a spinfusor, 'cuz he's
got delicate hands.

But a man on my team who throws a satchel charge at me RIGHT AS I'M
PICKING UP THE ENEMY FLAG? He dates his hand.
