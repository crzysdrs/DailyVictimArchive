What is this? The IRS wants a meeting? Well ... CRAP. That's what I get
for letting those [guys in the
forums](http://web.archive.org/web/20020418000000/http://www.forumplanet.com/gamespy)
do my taxes! I didn't even bother to look at my return -- the one guy
had over 700 posts so I figured he was reliable.

What's this?

According to this I claimed a rocket launcher as a neccessary home
office expense. Maybe that tipped them off. I could *kill* those forum
guys! They listed my income as "$ 1337 ." And listed my mortgage as
costing me $pw33n3d per year ... That's not even a number! They also
claimed that I was a member of the clergy, listing "Jedi" as my
religion. I probably shoulda skimmed this before sending it in.

I declared J.Lo's ass a dependant.

Next year I'm sticking to the chat rooms where I can confront these
so-called "tax experts" face-to-face.
