  \[A note from the author: I'd consider paying good money to anyone who could put
  the 'Chillin' With Boba' lyrics to music. Serious chill music, something Mace Windu
  would listen to while rolling in his landspeeder with the top down.\]

Hot desert sand  
 Got no 'saber in my hand  
 'jes a Colt 45 like Lan  
 Hangin' in the Can-  
 TINA  
 Bitches 'cuz the game is on  
 I'm gone  
 Gone on-line  
 When I'm not in line  
 For Episode III  
 You'll find me  
 Near Mos Eisley  
 Chillin' with Boba,  
 CHILLIN' with BOBA

Two scorching suns  
 You can make your runs  
 Smugglin' guns  
 Outrunnin' garrisons  
 I couldn't care 'bout  
 None of your rebellions  
 I'll be lighting a cigarette  
 Gettin' down with the Fett  
 No sweat, no threat  
 Gettin' bred  
 With that chick  
 With the tentacle head  
 I'll be  
 Chillin' with Boba,  
 CHILLIN' with BOBA

I said  
 Chillin' with Boba  
 CHILLIN' with BOBA

\[Pause\]  
 I will now take questions from the audience.

**"How do you plan for your character to earn a living in *[Star Wars
Galaxies](http://web.archive.org/web/20020605000000/http://www.gamespy.com/e32002/pc/swg)*
if all you do all day is hang out with Boba Fett?"**

I consider the art of professional gigoloism to be a tatooinian trade
secret. What I GOT is the special sumthun'. You and your wookiee-assed
bitches wouldnâ€™t even KNOW how to get down in THAT groove. Next?

**"How will you know where to find Boba Fett once the game starts?"**

Me and Boba are prepared to chill wherever and *when*ever the chillin'
is good. I refuse to entertain the possibility that my man BOBA would
not SEEK ME OUT for the hardcore, no-prisoners CHILLIN' that I and only
I can provide.

**"What kinds of things would you and Boba talk about?"**

What the hell kind of cherry-assed question is that? He's BOBA the
jimmykicking FETT, you son of a bitch. We'll talk about ... BOBA stuff.
Someone kick the squid out of my press conference. I'll take one more
question, because I'm sick of all y'all.

**"Are you worried that chill will be a hotbed for other players,
stragglers, and those less inclined to provide an ample chill milieu?
That is to say, that the very power of the chill itself will draw crowds
who would by their very presence disrupt the sanctity of said chill and
create a potentially unchillable situation with Boba, or, at the very
least, an ambience of far-reaching unfavorable chill conditions?"**

The chill will not be televised. Not be televised. Not be televised.
When I get down in the juice with Boba F-dawg, the chill will be REAL.
That is all I'm sayin'.
