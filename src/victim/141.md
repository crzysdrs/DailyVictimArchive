  do *I* care less? Of course not.

Mags -- you know, Mags? From *Phantasy Star Online*? Everyone has Mags.
They get bigger when you feed 'em, they can shoot special attacks, it's
all good, right?

Wrong! It's not all good! Last night after a ripping good time at
Hooters Carrie and I headed home to kick back with some *Phantasy Star*.
Oh, and a few shots of Tequila.

So one thing leads to another and pretty soon we're down in the mines
and I see this Hunter Chick stroll into the room, with the long long
legs and the BIGGEST set of MAGS I've ever seen.

I didn't even think, right? I just saw those big heavy Mags and I was
blown away. "Whhhee-oo!" I said. "Check out the size of THOSE!" Oh man,
it was over. There was a flash of light -- I think it was the wedding
ring before it ripped into my forehead -- and then the carpet came up to
meet me.

So now you know, right? You can admire another woman's mags, but man,
*don't say anything.*
