  Was that okay? If you like I can go back and do it again? I'd better do it again,
  just to make sure.

It all started with the original Quake 1. That's where I learned to hit
F6 all the time. See, the game started up, and at the beginning there
are three doors to choose from -- easy, medium, or hard. I thought, "Uh
oh. Better safe than sorry," and I saved the game.

To start the hard level, you had to jump over a pit of lava, right? I
walked up to the pit and hit save. Then I jumped and I saved in mid-air,
just to make sure I had a good landing. I saved when I got to the other
end, 'cuz I had made it. Then I went through the door and saved my game,
pleased with my progress.

I finished the original Quake without dying. If I so much as lost a
point of health I quick-loaded. If I used up too much ammo shooting a
monster I quick-loaded the game. Do you know exactly how many nailgun
nails it takes to kill a Shambler? I do. I didn't waste a single nail.
If I did, getting it back was only a quick-load away.

Then I played through Unreal. By this time I was a master of saving. I
bound quick-save to my left mouse button and quick-load to my right.

Soon I was ready for greater tactical challenges. I tried *Rainbow Six*
but there were no mid-level saves, so, I mean, where's the fun in that?

My quicksaving habits are really causing problems for my work ethic. For
instance, I back up my harddrive four times a day. When I write
documents in my word processor, I don't use the backspace key -- I save
every other word and if I make a mistake I merely revert to an old
document.

This morning I called my mother, and I said something wrong so I hung up
on her and called her right back.

Please help.
