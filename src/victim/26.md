In this antagonizing world the voice of the individual is so often lost,
particularly the solitary voice of a single mother. But please hear me
out. I know that many senators and important big people are trying to
regulate the video game industry with labels or ratings, but there are
so many behavioral problems that they simply fail to address, problems
that only a mother can understand.

For example, on the lava levels in the basement of the castle in Mario
64, it is not uncommon for the little plumber (my son's role model) to
have his buttocks set alight. He dances about, grabbing his behind, but
eventually recovers -- when he does so, he very clearly, just for an
instant, flashes the hand symbol of da Bloods.

I know that kids are smarter than to imitate what they see on the TV
screen, but frankly if my son were to flash the sign of da Bloods in the
supermarket he'd be capped right there in the Alpo aisle. We live in a
Crip 'hood, and my precious angel can't afford to be frontin'.

Please, please, censor your video game content before someone gets all
wu-tang'n'shit on my son's ass. Thank you, and peace out.
