  WOW, that kill would've been so much more satisfying if you weren't a complete stranger.

Don't just stand there staring at me like you're lagged. Look around
you. Since that [colossal server crash](@/victim/690.md) and the
[resulting backup & reboot](@/victim/692.md), this server's been
reset to the way it was a year ago.

That means our ridiculous February whirlwind romance and impromptu
online wedding is annulled. In fact, it's even better than annulled; it
never happened.

I would give you back the ring ... but it hasn't been forged yet.

Things are the way they were when we first met. That is to say, I'm a
low-level crafter scraping along trying to make a living in this little
shack I call home, and you're a helpless newbie who I was about to
attack with a hatchet.

We haven't yet hit it off, we haven't chatted drunkenly until the wee
hours, we haven't gradually grown attracted to one another, haven't sent
our pictures over the net, haven't gotten engaged, haven't had a big
online ceremony, haven't discovered the degree to which acne was
photo-edited out of the pictures we sent, haven't had that big fight in
June, haven't had those *agonizing* heart-to-hearts and "relationship
discussions" that cut away into time I could've spent getting XP. And
frankly, I think we're better off for it.

That reminds me.
