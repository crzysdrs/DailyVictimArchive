  Now, I need some silence. I figured out how to use a minor sequencer spell to do
  1,864 points of damage in a single round, and when you find a loophole like that,
  you to show it some respect.

That's right, script-kiddies. It's me, William "Wild Bill" Carson,
winner of two consecutive GENCon Advanced Dungeons and Dragons tourneys.
Second edition, of course -- the game for MEN! Men who like thick, meaty
rulebooks with loopholes scattered about like treasure in an umber hulk
lair!

I'm the new Rules Marshall on this here BG server, so you'd all best be
listenin' up. 'Cuz around here it ain't Role*Play*, it's Role*WORK!*

You, in the tunic -- A level 8 warrior who took the Kensai kit? What the
hell were you thinking? How did you have the patience to get to level 8?
You can't wear armor, how the high heavens do you expect to exploit any
rules if you can't wear armor? That's piss-poor, junior! What do you
think this is, your mamma's basement? 5 o'clock at the Piedmont Jr. High
after-school wargaming club? GET THE HELL OFF MY SERVER!

And how about you, Thor-Dak the Slayer? A wizard, eh? Let me see your
character profile -- SWEET JEEZES! You only have one primary stat at
18!! Is this a Baldur's Gate server or an f'ing kindergarten!? Log off
and come back when you learn to press the "reroll" button! For crying
out loud.

Do you know how long it took me to get my character up to 18/96 strength
with two other 18's in my stats? That's right, three consecutive days of
hitting the reroll button, but it was worth it! I devour beholders for
breakfast. I play this game with one blistered hand on the mouse and the
other in an open copy of the AD&D 2nd edition player's guide. That's
right, AD&D -- ADVANCED Dungeons and Dragons, for advanced players, not
these third-edition bleeding-heart "oh we want to develop our
character's rich personality" training-wheel rules.

Ya'll come back when you know the difference between Melf's Acid Arrow
and a hole in yer butt.
