  I guess it's not too late to beg for my real job back. Maybe those Japanese kids
  will hire me? Uh ... "Konnichiwa, uh ... dudes-san!"

The day of [the big tournament](@/victim/551.md) came, the first in
my career as a professional *Battlefield 1942* player. The tension in
the mall was tangible. Even the guy behind the Whattapretzel counter was
... nearly awake. It was hard to tell.

Myself? I was ready to go. I was on fire. My crew was strung as tight as
a violin. They were the kind of troops to win Medals of Honor, usually
posthumously.

“Soldiers, sailors, and airmen! You are about to embark upon the great
crusade toward which we have striven these many months. The eyes of
those chicks by the Piercing Pagoda are upon you!" I said, standing
before and American flag.

Over the next two hours, we won every match we played -- we raged
undefeated all the way to the finals. And that’s when we encountered our
nemeseses -- er, nemisii -- er -- nem -- our arch enemies. So far as I
could tell nobody on the other team had any names or individual
identity. Our final opponent was just a group of eight Japanese kids in
white tee-shirts with identical rising-sun Bandanas partially covering
their eyes. They were serious: during the semi-finals [the tournament
announcer](@/victim/517.md) had to step in and stop a guy from
committing hara-kiri when he accidentally bombed a teammate.

We drew straws and got the Wake Island map, American team. Our best map!
But when the fighting began, it was clear that we were in for a
knock-down drag-out. No sooner were we celebrating the sinking of the
Japanese carrier when the north outpost had fallen to their troops. And
then the nearby town. They roared toward the airfield with a tank and a
fully-stacked troop transport, but we fought them off by smuggling a
Pirate with a bazooka behind a shrubbery. Crenshaw led the
counter-attack from his tank, and for a time we held the town North of
the airfield, but then it fell to another rush. Ten minutes into the
battle we were ten tickets behind in a nearly dead-even stalemate ...
and then they took over the airfield.

“New strategy! New strategy!” I called out.

{% css_class(class="left clear") %}
[![](/img/victimpics/aug02/humanwave.gif)](@/victim/453.md)
**GENTLEMEN, IT’S TIME FOR THE HORRIFYING HUMAN WAVE ATTACK.**  
 Just because something [never works](@/victim/453.md) doesn’t mean
it’s not a legitimate wartime strategy. I announced “HUMAN WAAaaaAAVE!”
and the charge began. At first, the Japanese didn’t know what hit them.
All eight of us rushed the airbase, knives out or machine guns blazing.
After the initial shock, then came the laughter. Our tickets began
counting down faster than the DOW Jones. I myself lunged over a pile of
bodies and made it almost past the first sandbag bunker before I was
machine-gunned down by a tank sitting at the ammo dump. “I think we’re
making an impression!” I cried.
{% end %}

Ten minutes later we only had a handful of tickets left. “Stop! STOP!”
cried out our captain. “Regroup!”

“Oh sure, we’re down to eight tickets,” I said. “But their morale is
shaken. They know we’re *serious*. I think they’re about to break.”

Nonetheless, doom and gloom was the mood of the moment. The other team
still had 180 tickets. The only way to win now was to take over the
*entire* island. As everyone hung their heads in anticipation of grim
defeat, the great gray bulk of a Japanese destroyer drifted beside our
shore. To our surprise, Crenshaw peeked his head out of the door to the
bridge. “Stole it,” he explained. “Let’s roll.”

{% css_class(class="left clear") %}
[![](/img/victimpics/nov02/navalflogging.gif)](@/victim/511.md) **AT
LAST BOYS! TO THE SEA! NOW WE HAVE WHAT IS KNOWN, IN NAVAL TERMS, AS A
*REALLY BIG GUN.***  
 I vaulted into the water and swam up the side of the destroyer. This!
This was the kind of Naval Action [I was made for!](@/victim/511.md)
I love the way the deck of an ol’ girl like this reels under the
kickback of the 16-inch guns. Crenshaw and I spotted the enemy coming
down the hill toward the last town -- they were all grouped together!
They thought it was a turkey shoot! “GIVE EM HELL, CREANSHAW!” I cried,
and together we cut loose with every turret we had.
{% end %}

The peninsula exploded into a white-hot ball of fury, an arc of sand and
debris rushing out from the impact crater. Bodies flew. The remains of
their tank twirled in the air and crashed back to the earth, engulfed in
flames. The fight was on!

“Easy men!” our Captain cried. “There’s one ticket left for each of us.
DON’T GET KILLED.” We took it nice and slow. Crenshaw and I steamed up
the coast, hitting the ground in front of our troops with shell after
shell. They crept forward, securing a couple of tanks, pounding the
enemy cautiously from a distance. It was a slow advance, but it was
working.

Within a few minutes the airfield was ours, but not before Kevin fell to
a sniper bullet. As we moved into the North village our engineer
perished in the flaming belly of his tank, but the advance continued.
Suddenly, the deck of my destroyer shuddered. The Japanese were getting
it together and manning the shore batteries. Black smoke poured from the
hatches. “Help me fix the damage!” I cried, rushing out onto the deck
with a wrench in hand.

“I gotta go take care of something,” Crenshaw answered, diving into the
water.

“Come back! Get back here!” I howled, but it was no good. A few moments
later a message on my screen told me that Crenshaw was dead. Then
another shell from the shore pounded into the bow of our ship, and the
explosion threw me against a turret. Alarms clanged around me. “Go on
without me!” I called to the shore. A captain, you know, he always goes
down with his ship. I saluted as the cold, cold waves crept over my
chest and finally swallowed me whole.

We had only two lives left.

{% css_class(class="left",inline=true) %}
[![](/img/victimpics/sept02/color1942.png)](@/victim/466.md)**I BET
REAL WARS DON’T END THIS WAY.**  
 I watched the Destroyer slip under the waves and turned to my Captain
for orders. “If we take that last flag,” he said, “They won’t have any
place to respawn. Even though you and I are the last people on the team,
their tickets will count down instantly to zero and we’ll win. *We’ve
got to take that flag without dying!*
{% end %}

The two of us poked our heads up over the sandbags and fired off our
machine guns. One, two, three enemy soldiers fell but I took a bullet to
the arm. “I’m hit!” I cried.

The Captain didn’t stop to give advice. He saw an opportunity and lunged
for it! He vaulted over the sandbags and darted across the courtyard to
the first shack. I frantically reloaded while he tossed a grenade into
the window. A Japanese solider bought it. I stepped around the bunker
and ripped a clip into the window of an adjacent building while the
Captain rushed forward. Another enemy soldier fell! We were doing it!

“Now!” the Captain hollered, and I rushed forward. He made it to the
flag and then grabbed his chest as the crack of a sniper rifle filled
the air. “I’m -- hit!” he gasped. I dove to the dirt as my Captain fell,
but *not before the flag changed to neutral grey.*

By this time, most of the team had gathered around my monitor. If I
died, the game was over. But if I could hold that flag for just a few
more seconds, we’d own the whole island and the map would be won! I
sprang to my feet and threw myself against the corner of a shack just as
another sniper shot rang out. Hands shaking, I reloaded my weapon.
“C’mon, you can do it!” my teammates shouted. Even the girls at the
Piercing Pagoda were getting into it.

I dashed around the back of the building and then dove to the open
ground near the flag. The enemy sniper -- there! On the hill! I fired a
burst of bullets, and then another. The dust cleared ... he was dead!
The map was mine!

I stood up and limped to the flag. Soon it would change to the stars and
stripes. Victory was only moments away! Only moments!

Then, around my feet, I saw the must curious thing. It looked like a
shadow, a small but growing shadow. It was as though something were
falling from above. All around me my team grunted in confusion. What was
it? I looked up.

And a Jeep fell on my head, crushing me.

“BULLSEYE!!” screamed Crenshaw, leaping into the air. “WHOOO HOOO!!
BULLSEYE!”

“Crenshaw you dropped a Jeep on my head!” I howled. [you promised to
stop running me over with a Jeep!](@/victim/466.md)”

“I don’t think you appreciate just how much effort it took to make that
happen,” he replied.

The match was over -- we’d lost. Our opponents danced on the tables and
howled with joy. In one corner, I saw a [beefy little man
weeping](@/victim/550.md), something about a wedding ring. “I’m half
the woman I once was!” he sobbed.

Crenshaw has a pretty warped idea of patriotism.
