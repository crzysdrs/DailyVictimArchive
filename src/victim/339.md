  Do you like the small white stones that line this path? Ha ha! See, that's very
  clever of me, because they're not stones at all. They're human skulls buried up
  to the forehead. Looks beautiful next to the daisies, eh?

Hello, fair knight, mind where you step! Ever since I heard that
[*Dungeon
Siege*](http://web.archive.org/web/20020411000000/http://www.planetdungeonsiege.com/)
was going to be customizable, I couldn't wait to get my hands in the
dirt. The actual game editor hasn't shipped yet, but you'd be surprised
what you can do just by replacing a few bitmaps here and there. Come,
sit down on this manicured stump and let me show you my petunias -- oh,
hold on --

YOU! Get the hell offa my geraniums! Move it -- don't you -- put the
club of maiming down -- oh THAT'S it, That's the way it's gonna be? Come
taste somma THIS, you little... Ow You fucking Dwarf! OWWHH Have some
more OOhh. Bitch! Let's see your friends resurrect you from THAT!

Help me drag the body into the compost pile here, will you? Thank you
kindly!

I'm sorry dear fellow, where was I? Yes, I'm looking forward to when
this azalea bush blooms, it'll really compliment the coloring of this
blood-spattered farmhouse, don't you think? Oh ... why yes, yes, I do
occasionally get some untoward interruptions from interlopers who don't
share my love of foliage. Many people don't read the description of my
server: "A tranquil place of scenic solitude." Those chainmailed cretins
go tromping through my zen rock garden, then back into my rose bush and
ask where the monsters are, and I'm like, "It's a beautiful garden you
SON OF A BITCH!" And then comes the swords. And the bleeding.

One time a fighter attacked my llama-shaped topiary. It won.

No, you understand, I see my server as a quiet place where warriors can
come to sit amidst my flowering shrubs, maybe solemnly weed the young
vegetable plants, ruminating on the nature of man and beast or good and
evil as they immerse their hands in the warm, soft, rich soil -- oh hold
on --

GET OUT MY PUMPKIN PATCH WITH YOUR POISON CLOUD you BUTTLICKING TROLLOP
OF A SORCERESS! I will KILL YOU! I WILL STAB YOU with a SHOVEL!!
