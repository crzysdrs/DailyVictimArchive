That's right, all Summer I've been hanging out here at Mickey-D's inside
the garish pink, purple, and green Play Palace. Did you know they have
free video games here now? The sign says limit 10 minutes per customer,
but if any of these little twerps complain I just suplex 'em into the
ball chamber. "Winner stays!" I yell, before hitting them with the elbow
drop.

Because here, man, I'm a GOD. Sure, the game consoles are so low that I
have to get down on my knees to properly hold the controls, but here at
Harbor Park McDonald's I am *undefeated* at *Super Smash Bros. Melee.*
Here, watch my skillz:

What's your name, kid? Mikey? You're in what, second grade? Oh, going
into third? Big man! Do you know how to play this game? Okay, right, the
big green button tries to punch me. I say "try" because you're about to
FAIL! That's right, I'm the big monkey. I just punched you in the face.
What's that? What's that? You want some more? More for Mikey? Okay, let
me show you how to use the baseball bat. BAM! I just knocked you so far
off the board it's embarrassing. Gonna cry, Mikey? Gonna cry? Gonna
squirt some? I can't hear you crying because I DON'T LISTEN TO LOSERS.
Now step off, dinky. The kid with the diaper wants some of me, and I
plan to beat him down so hard his parents will have bruises.

Yeah, so where was I? Oh yeah, this place is great. All the video games
I can play and cheeseburgers when I'm hungry.

Tomorrow I think I'll come in dressed as Ronald and really mess with
their little heads.
