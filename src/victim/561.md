Last week I complained about your [obscene *SimCity* town
names](@/victim/556.md), such as the busy residential town of “a sex
orgy” and the bustling metropolis that is “My Anus.” But now things have
gone too far.

I was trying to get help on the *SimCity* technical support forum with
city connections on our regional map, but they threatened to delete my
forum account. “What are you talking about!?” I said in an angry email.
“All I did was post pictures of my anus to your forums!”

But my anus wasn’t the only source of difficulty. I was also having
problems getting power to “your ballsack,” to uplift its sagging
economy. “Look,” I argued on the forum. “Let’s just lay off my anus for
a second. I posted those pictures of a sex orgy so we can have a candid
discussion about problems I’m having with your ballsack.”

That got me banned completely.

Now, my cities are all in shambles and I can’t get ANY technical
support. I got crime up the wazoo in my anus, a sex orgy that’s going
nowhere, and your ballsack is a complete wreck. Next time, *I’m* naming
the towns, dig?
