  Yeah, half a bottle of Nyquil should pull me through study hall and music. Maybe
  Jim can stop by later and pull me outta school in traction.

Yah, I uh \*sniff\* I've come down with the bug hard, man. \*snuffle\*
No point in me cutting school today, I couldn't even defend the flag for
a couple minutes before I'd hab to stop and blow muh nose. \*snort\*

No, no, g'head without me. I feel like someone's been pounding my head
with an impact hammer. \*sniff\* I'm gonna go to school where I can
catch up on muh sleep n'stuff.

That's okay, that's cool, I'll get over it. A few hours of Mr. Heffer's
Bio class oughta put me right out, I'll feel all refreshed. \*Snif
snif\* Yep, sucks to be me. Y'all go ahead and cut class, I need the
break. Yeah, cap one for me, Jimmy. \*Loudly blows nose and moans\*
