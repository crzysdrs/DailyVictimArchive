  Though, I gotta admit ... the look on the pilot's face was *pretty priceless*.

Yeah ... yah I can't say I've seen it before, or that I've even read
about it in the hardware manuals, but I can almost definitely say that
the major issue we have here is that your tank is perched atop a swaying
palm tree, which definitely hampers what you would call it's "mobility."
Yah.

If I'm not mistaken you're the same Kommandant who [I warned about tank
abuse](@/victim/448.md). And, while it's not exactly *catalogued* per
se, I'd say having it perched atop a palm tree on a Pacific Island is
fairly abusive. How the hell did you GET it up there, anyw— you know
what? I don't want to know. No — no, zip it. I don't want to hear it.

Now, as for getting it down, well, I wouldn't recommend just firing off
the main gun. The recoil of that sucker would dump you out the back and
down onto the rear armor. No, let's back one of them 'ere wedge-shaped
APCs up against the tree, you know, so we can ease 'er down gently. Now,
I'd — holy crap — there's a GUY up in that tank?

Hey! You there! In the tank— whoa — whoa now — slow, gentle
movements. We're gonna get through this. Just uh, focus on your
breathing or uh, something. What? Say again?

Great, he's gotta take a leak. Hey, hey Earl? Get a bucket over here by
the palm tree. And what's the story on the APC? Oh? It was bombed by
enemy fighters? Yaaaaahh... okay that's bad. Hey you! Up in the tank!
No, the tank IN THE TREE you MORON. If you see any airplanes, get behind
that gun and start schutzing, capisce?

Okay, Earl, what are you doing here? BUCKET! Now! Right, so uh — oh
crap, here comes a plane. Hit the dirt! INCOMING! You in the tank —
FIRE!

\[The whirring roar of an airplane is drowned out by a deafening
explosion, followed by the howling spiral of a plane falling to earth
and a curious crunch of falling metal and cracking palm fronds\]

Nice one, Hirohito. I meant for you to fire the *machine guns*,
numbnuts. At least the tank is on the ground. You're lucky I have a
wrench — what's that smell? Aw for cryin' out ... Earl? Forget the
bucket.

I don't get paid enough for this.
