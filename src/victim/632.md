  And even if it WAS working, your whole bedroom would be like a cancer machine. I
  bet I'd be able to see my bones through my skin. In fact, I think I almost can,
  here in this dark room lit only by the smouldering glow of hot cathode ray tubes...

I told you, I TOLD you you didn't need eight 21-inch crt monitors
arranged in a two-deck semi-circular array around your PC but NOOOO, no,
you don't ever want to listen to me. It's always, "live a little this"
or "Be true to your inner geek that," and then you were always saying,
"Oh, but I NEEEEEED to play my *NASCAR 4* with the eight-monitor
panorama view" or "Oh oh I NEEEEeeeed to Play *Unreal Tournament 2003*
on one screen while I check my email on another and monitor bandwidth on
this screen and keep the hot-chick-cam live on this screen" yadda yadda
yadda.

And NOW look at what you've done. After spending the last week cutting
plywood, painting and bolting together the ultimate workstation and
filling your whoooooole bedroom corner with monitors, you reach down to
plug in your demonic array and WHAM!

You take down the powergrid for most of New England and Eastern Canada.

New Yorkers wandering out of their silent offices in 90-degree heat,
people are trapped in subway cars, French Canadians are bi-lingually
swearing, and for *what?*

I *told* you you shoulda used flatscreens.
