Me Gronk.

Gronk work at PC-SonicLabs.

Gronk job: Put "Speakers" into "Boxes" to "Ship" them to "Customur."
Gronk not technikal. Hold "Speaker" up to ear — didn't talk to Gronk.
Speakers never talk, why name it speaker? Gronk disappointed in every
one.

And where ship? No ship, just big truck. Gronk throw boxes into truck
very hard.

Gronk boss wear tie. Says to put speakers in boxes. Sometimes easy:
Speaker fit. Sometimes hard. Speakers are long on one side and short on
the other, but box is sometimes long on the opposite side and short on
the other, Gronk can never tell until he put box on table and look at
speaker to see. Speaker not fit? So Gronk CRAM SMASH! GRONK SMASH! SMASH
SPEAKER FOR NOT TALKING TO GRONK! SMASH INTO BOX LIKE MAN WITH TIE SAYS!

Then Gronk put in styrofoam peanuts. Job well done. Customur should
thank Gronk.
