  I'm the capper. We decided that when we got married. I said, 'Look, I gotta be capping
  or I'm less of a man.' She understood.

Heya Hank. 'Sup? No no, just gettin' the lawn ready for Fourth of July
and all. Was that you we saw on the server last night playing under the
name 'Taco Jackass?' Well, yeah, the name kinda had you written all over
it.

Yeah, that was my wife up there sniping for the blue team. Oh, tell me
about it. She laid waste to more reds than the war in Afghanistan.

No, no man. I wasn't embarrassed, you know, just because everyone called
her a hero and asked her to join their clans. I'm cool with that. A lot
of guys my age, they're like, "A woman's place is barefoot in the flag
room with a proximity mine launcher" but I consider this a pretty
liberated family, and if my wife wants to get up there and kick enough
butt to make a butt-salad the size of Philadelphia then hey. I'm cool
with that. Really.

But you understand -- I still run the flag in this family. I mean, a
man's got his business, that never changes. Know what I'm saying? She
might have been at the top of the frag count, yah. Accused of being a
bot, yah. Uh, revered on fan pages across the web including one in a
language I don't recognize with her picture painted on velvet, sure
sure. She can have that. But *I'm* the one out there bringing home the
flags. That's all I'm sayin'.
