Whenever I play [*Medieval: Total
War*](http://web.archive.org/web/20021206000000/http://gamespy.com/fargo/december02/medieval/),
I try to exhibit the good medieval-era Christian piety and humility that
gives you the right to kill other people. What I’m saying is, if the
Pope says you gots to go, then you GOTS to go!

So I turn my attention at last to you, the Holy Roman Empire. You
bible-printin’ sausage-eaters. Sure, you just waged a successful
campaign against France, taking their most valuable, juicy, tempting,
succulent lands, but the Pope excommunicated you for it. How am I
supposed to react, playing as the English? I ask myself, what’s a good
medieval Christian to do? I know: He’d kill. Dish out ye Olde
Smack-Downe.

That’s why I’m declaring a CRUSADE against you, my excommunicated
friend! I don’t do it for my own glory, nor do I do it for the rich,
rich, wealthy, *fertile* lands I will take from you. I do it because I’m
a holy man, a righteous man. And pious men such as myself have no choice
but to remove from your possession those immensely profitable imminently
exploitable regions. Not for myself! Oh no, the money I make after
pillaging your lands and repopulating them with citizens loyal to me,
no, that money’s not for ME. It’s for the Almighty. Sweeping across
Europe and subjugating its people under my rule is simply the burden I
bear.

Amen.

Okay boys, let’s kill.
