  Then there was that man with the paint roller and the air rifle. He was scary. Not
  untalented, mind you. Just ... scary.

Fans, it's my duty to inform you that Daily Victim artist Mike "Gabriel"
Krahulik will shortly no longer be illustrating this feature. Wearing an
astronauts pressure suit, he explained that he had important work
elsewhere, and -- pausing to don his helmet and check his oxygen levels
-- he stalked out of the room. Our natural inclination was to loot and
riot, preferably in reverse order, but cooler heads prevailed.

Instead, the other Daily Victims and I have started a campaign to find a
new illustrator. I was elected as chairperson, namely because I am
holding a clipboard. So then we come to the heart of the matter. Are
you, or is anyone you know, a comic illustrator? Do you have what we in
the industry refer to as the "Skillz" to pay the "Billz?" Do you have a
flexible style, an ability to draw new characters day after day? Can you
do magic tricks, like making a lion disappear? If so, you might have
just what we are looking for. Specifically, a lion. Er wait --
\[scribbles something out on the clipboard\] I mean, TALENT!

I'll be tracking our progress in this matter over the next few days, so
stop by for updates. Already this morning a few people stopped by to
show me their "portfolios." One man looked very promising but he only
drew [shoes](/img/victimpics/shoes.gif). I asked him what kind of feature
this could possibly be if day in and day out we were to show people
nothing but shoes. Pausing to think, then mopping his brow, he asked me
if I wanted to see his dirty pictures of high-heels. I escorted him out
but not before buying a couple.

So you can see this will not be an easy task. But, if you're up to it,
[Mail Fargo@GameSpy.com](mailto:fargo@gamespy.com) and point him toward
your online portfolio! He'll weed out the best among you and give them
to me. Stay tuned for details!

contact [Fargo](mailto:fargo@gamespy.com) and make it happen!\]*
