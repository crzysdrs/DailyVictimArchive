These light gun games? You know how easy it is to play two-player by
yourself? That's a trick I learned from TV. I soon discovered the
sublime beauty of [holding guns akimbo](@/victim/73.md). Then I got
*[Action
Half-Life](http://web.archive.org/web/20010706000000/http://www.gamespy.com/fargo/april01/action/)*,
where I learned the subtle joys of jumping through plate glass windows,
arms extended, and rolling across the floor. Now I was PLAYING.

But, even then, I didn't really have any *technique.* I'd flip over the
couch, scream "BUSTED MUTHAFLUBBA!" But ... I had no style, you know? It
was all slop. But that all changed when I discovered *MTV's Jackass*.

Nowadays I start a new level, then I put pillows all over my body like a
big fat suit, cover myself with leeches, strap on a snowboard, then come
tearing into the room on a red wagon with a fake plastic baby doll in a
car seat on the front yelling things while my friends videotape me,
light guns blasting away.

Frankly, my scores have dropped, and I've spent several days
hospitalized, but c'mon. The man has STYLE.
