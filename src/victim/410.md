I am telling you the complete and honest truth! There is something
SERIOUSLY funky with the *Warcraft III* collector's edition box. Here,
try some. Give it a good lick. No, don't just touch it with your tongue,
you need a full-on french lick action to catch any kinda buzz. No, it's
not mine, this is my roommate's copy. What, you think I'd sit around
licking my own game boxes? That would just be weird.

Do you feel it? Okay, hang on, wait for it to hit. I dunno man, just
some crazy funky ink or some'thun. WHOA, there you go. Nice, hunh? Some
kinda crazy orc-buzz! I love it! In fact, here, gimmie the box back.
Let's see what slurpin' the systems specs'll do for me.

DAMN that's ... CRAAazzzy! Woo-oo! I see elves. Whoa. Damn. Hey dude,
did you ever wonder if there's ... like ... a planet full of Orcs? And
they all have Warcraft too, right? But, on their planet, the *Orcs* won
the second game? That's seriously whacked up. That blows my mind. Hand
me that bag of potato chips.

Let's get Chunksalot and Dogslobber and the rest of the clan over here.
Party with the *Warcraft* box! Woo woo!

[![](/img/victimpics/jun02/uneasy.png)](@/victim/401.md) **Hey, what
did you guys DO to my *Warcraft III* collector's edition?**  
 When I left the house to go to the movies late this afternoon it was
right here on the desk. Now, it's on the coffee table, next to six
crumpled bags of chips, two empty containers of squeezie cheese, and a
box of doughnuts. Also, that box had been signed by the developers
themselves with those special metallic pens, and now ALL the signatures
are *gone!* Furthermore, and perhaps most disturbing, the box is moist
to the touch. You know what? I don't want to know. No really. I ...
don't want to know.
