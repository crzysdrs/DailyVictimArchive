  I also have the uncomfortable feeling that people are watching me, and judging me
  — you know, casting votes — some kind of Karma thing. I think I'm being watched.
  I think they're listening to me *right now*.

WHAT!? Oh, it's you.

I'm sorry, I'm a little on edge ever since my housemate showed me a
video game called "Chu Chu Rocket" for the Dreamcast. See, there are
these little mice that run away from cats, and escape into rocketships
— that's what the game is about. But here's the freaky part! Just last
week I had a *dream* about mice flying rockets to get away from
monsters. I swear I did. It's as though these sick multicolored visions
were pulled directly from my head and made silicon before my eyes.

That's not the first time it happened, either. You know that girl in the
expresso place, the one who wears the tight orange CoffeeHut shirt? I
had a dream about her once, too — no, not one of *those* dreams — I
mean, I was in the coffee shop, but then aliens came down, and suddenly
the coffee chick was in a space station, and she was trying to save the
earth from Michael Jackson by *dancing.* I assumed I dreamed that only
because subconsciously I long for carnal relations with her, which is
why, by the way, I'm so wired on caffeine right now that I'm seeing
three of you and my bladder is quivering uncontrollably.

Where was I? OH YES! The very next day my housemate turned on his
Dreamcast and showed off a new game called "Space Channel 5," where this
orange chick dances around in space, just like my dream. THIS WAS REALLY
STARTING TO FREAK ME OUT. Somehow this "Dreamcast" thing is wired into
my brain. Why else would they name it that? You saw in the paper how
that University student rigged up a Nintendo so that he could [move
Pikachu with his mind?](@/victim/36.md) Well, I think my housemate
secretly did that to his Dreamcast, and he's sucking the dreams right
out of my head at night using aluminum foil sheets scotch-taped to top
the ceiling fan right below my bedroom.

But I'll show him! Last night I had a dream so bizarre, so convoluted,
that it'll never show up on a video game system! See, I was this huge
yellow glutton, no more than a giant mouth. And I was trapped in a maze,
and I had to keep eating these little white things to live, I suspect it
was mana from heaven. But I was haunted by apparitions of the dead!
Fortunately, if I ate big dots, the spirits would turn ghastly blue and
flee. Most assuredly such mental images are mine and mine alone — Ha
ha! I'm safe!
