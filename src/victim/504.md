No, I worry because my little brother is outside with his friends and
they’re taking turns “jacking” his little red wagon. Look at them out
there. It looks like a cross between the TV show Cops, school recess,
and an episode of “Jackass.”

This is what I get for letting him play an “M” rated game. What are we
teaching the youth of Ameri-- oh, wait. Now they’re playing a different
game. It looks like my brother’s got the firehose, he’s inviting his
friend to sit in the back -- awwww! Isn’t that sweet? They’re going to
play “Fireman,” which you can also do in *Grand Theft Auto*. Well, I
take back what I said, that’s some good wholesome fun.

Hang on ... hold up ... they’re not playing Fireman with that hose. He’s
... *practicing his drive-by technique?* Well, I’d put a stop to it,
except he’s got a hose and I’m wearing a new wool sweater.

Now, where did his little friend Timmy go? Oh, there he is, by the
garage. *HE’S GOT A CHAINSAW!* ... and since when did Timmy learn to
speak Cuban? Well, I’d better put a stop to this. Do me a favor and
distract my brother while I make a run for the garage. Oh, and if he
pulls up next to you in the wagon and says, “Hop in, baby!” ... don’t
get in.
