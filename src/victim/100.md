  Maybe I should try a different player model.

I spawned in, and immediately moved toward the enemy base. I had my
route all planned out, juking toward the jump-pad and then instead
making a beeline for the ramp. But, here, friend, is the crux of my
flawless strategem: I was going to *hop* the entire time!

I was going to hit the space bar at regular intervals. Perhaps even hold
it down. I was to leap! leap! leap! leap! Ad infinitum! Thus rendering
me immune to rockets or rails, bullet or buckshot!

And yet, as I hopped up the ramp — Huyah! Huyah! Huyah! Huyah! Huyah!
Huyah! Huyah! — I was incinerated by a rocket, my innards spewing forth
like the undulating whipped topping of a frosted mocchachino.

But *HOW!??* I was *jumping up and down!* JUMPING! Up! ... and down!
Certainly I could see getting hit by a rocket were I foolish enough to
jump once. Or even twice. But my continuous jumping — jumping over and
over again, as one would in real combat — certainly the enemy couldn't
have seen that coming!

He must've been cheating.
