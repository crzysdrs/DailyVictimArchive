Ho -- hee-eey, you there! I recognize your face, even in your new tunic.
You're that guy [I tried to sell my rubicite breastplate
to](@/victim/54.md)! At the time you seemed shocked that I preferred
human babies as currency, but surely by now you've gotten used to it. In
my circles, at least, I know *EverQuest* players going through six or
eight babies a week while trafficking in really phat lewt. I know a guy
who took in a pair of healthy white twins for a single Rune Branded
Girdle. True.

But lets not mince words. You have a Fungus Covered Scale Tunic. It
gives its user fungal regrowth, an awesome combo for a troll like me.
Me? I got *baby*. Let's talk business!

How about a small dark-skinned child? Let me send you a pic. See, his
teeth are starting to come out! Hmm, you seem offended. Well, then, how
about this eight month old. She's got reddish hair. I'm sure she'll grow
up to be beautiful someday, although you'll probably sell her for a
staff or something long before. No? Don't like redheaded children? Damn,
I'm having a lot of trouble pawning her off. Okay, what if I were to
deliver you a fresh, *juicy* newborn? Hey, don't run, I'm serious. I've
got people. I can swing it. Come back! Okay, two babies! And 20K Plats!
