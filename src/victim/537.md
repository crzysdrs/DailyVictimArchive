  Ah, look! It's the town mayor. I'll ask him what happened to the missing orphans.
  Oh -- yeah, you're right, it might be scary to approach him in full armor. Could
  you hold it for me?

Hello, my name’s Kevin. I’ve been roleplaying for most of my life, which
is how I found the address of this support group, stapled crookedly to
the moist bulletin board just inside the entrance to Skeeve’s Gaming and
Card Collectables shop.

\[Hi, Kevin!\]

You see, the problem I have is that I find it difficult to roleplay a
*mean* person. I guess I’m just what you’d call a naturally nice,
sensitive guy. For instance, take that new [Divine
Divinity](http://web.archive.org/web/20030102000000/http://www.gamespy.com/reviews/october02/divinedivinity/)
game. It’s totally open season on there. So, I decide to play a
character who’s a real dick. In fact, that’s what I named him. “Dick.”
He was a thief.

\[Groans of understanding.\]

But the spirit is willing where the penile drive is weak! I just
couldn’t bring myself to be a jerk. When the innkeeper who rescued me
said I was free to use any of his provisions, I just couldn’t force
myself to slit his throat, hang his body in the closet, and sell all of
his china. Instead, I thanked him. And I gave him a pair of boots.

\[Rumbles of ascension.\]

Later I told the town mayor I’d rescue some children. *And I did*. Dick
just can’t be a jerk! He’s flaccid!

\[Everyone talks at once.\]

Well, sure. Yeah, I pen and paper roleplay, as well. Okay, I’ll join the
group. My favorite character is a level 13 Bard. Yeah, he’s got a +5
Shadow Dagger. Sure, you can borrow it. You’ll give it back, though,
right? Right?
