That’s right, I “enlisted” the moment the game came out. I completed
that training course in record time. And ‘cuz I’m a PATRIOT, I’ve been
playing it every night. I’ve done my part for the secure future of the
United States of America!

So where’s my college money, bitches? I heard about the Montgomery G.I.
bill. And Uncle Monty says I got 50 g’s coming toward my college
education. That’s right, cheerleaders and beer. PlayStation 2 until dawn
with a couple of co-eds on my lap. Werd to many thousands of mothers far
and wide.

I served my country ... now fork over the benjamins!
