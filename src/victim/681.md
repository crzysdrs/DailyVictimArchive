That's right Skip. Open the envelope. It may LOOK like a [GameSpy Gift
Card](http://web.archive.org/web/20031203000000/http://net.gamespyid.com/linktrack/redirect.aspx?i=6185&t=http%3a%2f%2fwww.gamespy.com%2fsubscribe%2fgift%2f),
but in fact, it's actually an inexpensive discount gift-certificate for
a MANBEATING.

I like you, Skip. You're a good friend. A great suite-mate here in the
dorms. Together we've had a lot of fun playing *Medal of Honor* or
*Wolfenstien*. So, really truly and genuinely, this is a gift from the
heart. But don't be misled. It's also an admission pass to the
SMACKFARM.

It's a guaranteed BEATDOWN.

Because as soon as I get a hold of you in *Call of Duty* multiplayer,
I'm gonna pulp you like ripe mango.

I'm gonna frost you like a cake. I don't even know what that means.

So, enjoy your gift card, Skip. Go online and activate it today. But
remember, it's not only a subscription you can take advantage of. It's
also a one-way ticket to a DEBILITATING NUTPUNCH.

Enjoy it, Skip. You've earned it.
