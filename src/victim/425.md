Extra Extra! In a joint session before congress this morning President
George W. Bush declared an unequivocal War on Camping.

Leading analysts believe the declaration of war was prompted by last
evening's extended play session with the [America's
Army](http://web.archive.org/web/20020726000000/http://www.fileplanet.com/files/80000/89806.shtml)
game. Despite completing all of the training sessions, the world leader
was unable to successfully defend the base with his teammates once he
joined a special capitol-hill server frequented by Washington insiders.

"I believe the 'merigan people are a strong people," the President
stated as flashbulbs went off all around. "And I believe in what the
constit-uation says, that we have an un-intelligible right to pursue
happiness. And that means y'all don't get sniped in the head by some
jackmunch hidin' behind a tree."

He then reached out and pointed an accusatory finger at Senator Thomas
Carper (D) of Delaware and Representative Ernie Fletcher (R) of
Kentucky, congressmen who he later accused of being the "axis of
camping."

"This administration will not negotiate with camping bitches," President
Bush announced to thunderous applause. He then made a gesture where he
pointed two fingers at his eyes and then pointed at House Minority
Leader Richard Gephardt. Licking his lips, he nodded slowly and with
great menace toward the Democratic leader.

Because campers are not an officially recognized U.N. nation, the head
of state technically does not need to seek congressional approval before
declaring war on them.
