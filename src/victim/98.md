  Hmmm, I'm not sure if I have Joey's ICQ number on here. Let me check. What I can
  do is take my address book and then sort it according to how much ass everyone munches.
  Ah! There he is! Second from the top.

Oh, you want some, do you? Allow me to make a note of that in my pocket
organizer! I'll file you under "Wants some."

Now then, when are you available to accept the administration of the
spanking? I have some openings available this afternoon. Allow me to
confer with my Outlook calendar. Ah yes, I see I have some time
available here between 3:15 and 3:45. Shall I pencil you in for a
tentative ass-whuppin?

Excellent! What map should we play on? Of course it matters. A 20-frag
deathmatch on "Annihilation Station" takes approximately thirteen
minutes according to my records, whereas "Wastehole" could take as long
as twenty minutes. We've got to work this out. Oh, you say? Hang on
while I annote your record in my address book to reflect that you're a
total choad.

Uh oh, my Palm Pilot is beeping now. I have this time set aside to surf
some adult websites. Ciao!
