Seriously. No, I know better than to [mess with the
IRS](@/victim/345.md), but this is [straight-up
legitimate.](https://web.archive.org/web/20030701000000/http://www.forumplanet.com/gamespy/topic.asp?fid=1422&tid=1087678)

See, at the start of 2003 I had a kick-ass Dwarf character with an
accumulated lewt value of at least [six healthy white
babies](@/victim/284.md) or as many as twelve [kicks to the
jimmies](@/victim/333.md). A veritable fortune in digital goods.

Since then, I've died several times and never made it back to my corpse.
Also, some of my key items were nerfed in monthly updates, and others
are now common enough to erode their value. With the expansion packs all
pushing the envelope, there are characters far, FAR more powerful than
mine up for sale.

By my calculations, that stupid Dwarf has gone down in value at least
$3600 this year -- that's losses from lewt alone. Factor in monthly fees
and you can tack another $120 of losses onto that figure by December.

So, I just claim those losses on my 1040 long form and I'm on easy
street. I figure the government will owe ME money! Playing bad has never
felt so GOOD!
