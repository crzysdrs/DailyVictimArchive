What exactly [happened](@/victim/580.md) between you and Tingle? I
mean, Steve? Did you guys have some sort of [falling
out?](@/victim/581.md) On my way here I saw him climbing out of your
bedroom window in his Tingle costume, hollering something about his
missing “Tingle Tuner.” Then he spread his arms and yelled “Whoom-pah!”
... and fell two stories into the compost pile.

A couple minutes later he emerged from your garden shed, covered in
leaves and grass clippings. He’d made a makeshift grappling hook out of
a hand-held rake and some rope. He also carried what appeared to be your
weed-eater. It was hard to tell, because he tied a red-polka-dotted
hanky filled with stuff to it.

He tossed some confetti into the air and then ran off.

Do you think he’s up to something dangerous? Hmmm ... yeah, yah I see
where you’re coming from. And I know what you mean about wanting to be
able to play through *Zelda* without having your friend suspended from
the ceiling throwing confetti at you. But I’m really starting to worry
about Steve. What will happen to him? In this state of mind, where is he
going to go? I think we should arrange some sort of search party.

No, really. I don’t know if you noticed this or not, but I’m beginning
to suspect that Steve took playing Tingle really seriously.

Or is it just me?
