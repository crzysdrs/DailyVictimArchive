By the power of mutha\[censored\]Greyskull, when will my \[censored\]
Tiger ever learn that it's supposed to EAT the \[censored\] villagers?
FOR THE LOVE OF ME!

The game is called *[Black and
White](https://web.archive.org/web/20010329000000/http://www.planetblackandwhite.com/)*,
but in the case of my dumbass Tiger, they should call it *Black and
Stupid*. You get to raise these little pipsqueak creatures to do your
bidding, right? When Cringer was a cub I caught him eating my prized
livestock, so, you know, I gave him the thrashing of his \[censored\]ing
life. I rained down the smack like Iraq. If this game had a choke hold,
I woulda used it.

Anyways, the little \[censored\] was scarred for life. For instance, one
time he was hungry so I handed him a big fat pig, and he just patted it
softly on the head and then set it gently on the ground. And he won't
even go *near* the cows -- runs away screaming and hides on the other
side of the lake like a pussy. (Although, I guess, technically he is.)
All he eats is grain. That's right.

I GOT A \[censored\]ING VEGETARIAN TIGER!

Yeah, lots of fun in a fight, you know, having the Tiger on your side
politely requesting a \[censored\] veggieburger. One time I picked him
up and threw his scrawny ass into the enemy village. "KILL!" I ordered
him, waving my finger frantically across the screen. "MAIM! CRUSH!
DESTROY! CHEW! DEFACE! SWALLOW! RAZE! PUT THE KIBOSH ON THOSE BITCHES!"

He then proceeded to pick up a small enemy child and reunite it with its
weeping mother.

SON OF A FAT BITCH!
