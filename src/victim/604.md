  What's this strange forest? Oh wait, it's just a field of dead horses, their legs
  upright in the air, horseshoes clanking in the breeze...

I'm talking about this new *Age of Shadows* expansion pack for *Ultima
Online*. One of the things it adds is the ability to dismount opponents.
I didn't think it was a big deal, either, until I discovered that *you
can KILL the horses!* Well, this just makes it all the worthwhile.

Wait, shhh! What perfect timing -- here comes some guy on a horse! Look
at him, with his horse. And his armor. And a horse. And his title. With
a horse. All smug in his rare cloak, with his horse, all up there high
and mightly like ... some guy on a horse. I hate him. Actually, I hate
everybody: I'm a griefer, like you.

So, here, take my lance. Now, the idea is, you knock him off ... then
you kill his horse and run for it. It's a real pisser. I can't wait to
see how angry he gets. I do it all the time. I've killed as many as 70
horses in one hour -- five from the same guy! -- that's over a horse a
minute. I'm like a walking glue factory. Okay! He's here! Now, block the
road...

That's it, now, POKE! Good, he's off! Get the horse! Kill it! KILL! --
what, dude what are you doing? Don't attack the guy, get his defenseless
horse! No, aw, now you've gone and killed the dude. Where's the
humiliation? The aggravation? What kind of a weak sauce griefer ARE you?
You're not griefy enough for THIS club, mister. Get out.

Okay, everyone? I think I've had enough. The weekly meeting of the
Atlantic Shard Griefers Guild is now closed. You can all kill each other
and steal each others' stuff now. Ow! Owh, HEY!
