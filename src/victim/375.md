  "We've been having a lot of trouble with security," the cops explained to me. "Why,
  just outside some crackpot is claiming to be you. Don't worry, we cuffed him and
  handed him to the Marines."


  "Domo Arigato," I answered.

\[All this week -- special victims as part of [GameSpy's Massive E3
Coverage](https://web.archive.org/web/20020523000000/http://gamespy.com/e32002)!\]

Hello. Don't be fooled. I'm not the *real* Shigeru Miyamoto -- creator
of Mario, Zelda, and numerous other Nintendo classics. My name is Gary.
My uncanny resemblance to the legendary Miyamoto would have been of
little consequence were it not for the machinations of my fellow
university students, who were desperate to get into E3, the largest
gaming convention in the world. Sadly, it is a trade-only event... But
this was worthy of little consideration for true gaming fans.

"Hey Gary!" they said. "Hold on a minute -- put on this suit jacket.
Sweet Luigi! You look JUST like Miyamoto!" My friends hatched a plan
wherein we would all rush the front doors of E3, claim to be Miyamoto
and company, and waltz right in without the necessary passes. Pretty
soon they were coaching my voice to thicken my accent. They never
thought to ask me what *I* thought of their plan. They just assumed I
would go along. Oh, how I hate to be soft and pliable. Would the *real*
Shigeru accept this kind of treatment? Would he bow in to their peer
pressure? I can only sigh and wonder what a man in his position would
do.

To complete the illusion, my friend Charles rented a Mario costume with
an enormous plush head. His logic was that nobody could deny that I was
Shigeru if I was accompanied by Mario, and we'd all get in. Dressed in
suits and ties and Mario costumes, we must've looked like quite a scene
as we taxied to the Los Angeles Convention Center.

{% css_class(class="left clear") %}
![](/img/victimpics/may02/mario.png) So I told him, "Listen, pipsqueak!
When we get out of this cab and walk toward convention center security,
you better get Shiggy with it or I'm gonna kick you ass up and down the
Hollywood Hills!"
{% end %}

Bad enough to be in a stinky cab in sweltering Los Angeles weather with
a giant Styrofoam HEAD on my ... head. But the whole way up there I
gotta listen to Gary -- our mealticket -- whining about how this is
morally wrong. You want to hear morally wrong? How about a trade show
showing the PHATTEST games in the universe and it's limited to "Industry
Only." Let me tell you. Not since Captain Lou has anyone had better
reason to don the Mario rags, baby.

So we stumble up to the convention hall doors dragging Gary beside us,
and security stops us to look at our badges. But we don't need no
steenkin' badges. "Shigeru Miyamoto! Shigeru Miyamoto!" we're all
yelling. Everyone's pushing and shoving. "Shigeru has to get through!"
"Do you realize who this is?" "Mr. Miyamoto has an important Nintendo
appointment." And everyone's buying it. People are backing away. They're
pointing at Gary and taking pictures.

Then one of the rent-a-cops looks at me and actually has the nerve to
say, "And who are you?" WTF? So I tells him, in a voice muffled by my
enormous noggin, "It's-a Me! Mario! You farkin' Ice-a hole-a!"

Then I tried to flip him off, but these gloves only have four fingers,
so I was confused as to which was the middle one.

{% css_class(class="left clear") %}
![](/img/victimpics/may02/shiggy.png) As simple as that, we were in. The
whole group of us. I felt very, very dirty. Immediately of course my
friends abandoned me and split off in all directions to see all the new
games, except for Charles who announced through his foam Mario head that
he "Had to take-a leak-a" and stalked off to the bathroom.
{% end %}

But before I could get my bearings an elderly Japanese man in a dark
suit grabbed me by the arm. "Shigeru-san!" he said. "You left your badge
at the booth. You must always keep your proper identification with you
at all times!" With a respectful bow, he clipped Shigeru Miyamoto's
nametag onto my blazer and then took me by the arm. "Come, the press is
waiting for your three o'clock! We worried you were stuck outside,
unable to return without your badge."

Over his shoulder, I saw security frisking the real Miyamoto, while he
pounded his fists helplessly on the glass. Should I have said anything?
At this point, I was too scared to call attention to the snafu. After
all, these things tend to work themselves out.

Talking to the press was far easier than I thought. Newsweek, Time, CNN,
GameSpy, and others asked me questions. I pretended to be shy, and
answered by talking about how much I like Mario. And the GameCube. And
... whatever else I could think of. They ate it up. Every word I said
was so important, they wrote it all down.

It felt ... good. Very, very good. I was in control.

Within an hour I was on the show floor telling Nintendo executives how
it should be done. I told them how incredible online gaming could be.
"Shigeru-san, why have you not spoken up before?" they asked. I just
shrugged. In the distance, I saw Charles, still in his Mario costume,
get kneed in the balls by an angry booth babe. My life had certainly
taken a bent toward the pleasantly surreal.

Suddenly, a group of balding executives with severe-looking glasses
barged into the booth, dragging with them my group of university
friends, all but Mario (who presumably was doubled over in pain
somewhere.) Even more disturbing, two armed security guards followed
behind. "Shigeru-san!" the executives asked, their voices restrained but
quivering. "These unlicensed convention attendees claim that you allowed
them onto the show floor. If that is indeed the case, it would bring
GREAT DISHONOR to the Nintendo name for having caused such a scandal!"

I looked at my friends, then back at the executives. "I've never seen
these men before in my life," I explained. "Take them away."

Security grabbed my squealing friends by the arms and began to
forcefully eject them from the building, but not before they cried out
to me for help. "What are you DOING!?" they hissed.

"I apologize gentlemen," I whispered to them. "But sometimes, your
career has to come first."
