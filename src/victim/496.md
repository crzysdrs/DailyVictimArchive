  Yah, Teamkilling. It's like a cancer. Except, it's not as intelligent as cancer.

Let me paint you the picture, right? Wake Island. *Battlefield 1942*.
We’ve got this wedge-shaped island locked down, right? The upper flag is
in contention, but we’ve got some armor on the way. I’m holding down the
Southwest part of the island with a couple other GIs.

Our team is working together. We’re SMOOTH. We’re tight. We’re in
control. We’re like a hive, man. You hear me? A HIVE. Our island defense
was impenetrable. I was feeling good, watching one of our guys named
“Beefmeat” manning the AA guns take out another Japanese Zero, when this
Newb on my team gets up onto the turret of my tank. “Good deal,” I
think, “I’ve got another gunner.”

Suddenly, with a single prolonged unremorseful burst of fire, he
*machine-guns Beafmeat right there in the AA gun!* I couldn’t believe
it. What a moron. What a jerk. I hate teamkillers. Guys like that really
spoil a game.

Beafmeat was even more enraged than I was. He came back a moment later
with a bazooka. Suddenly, my tank exploded from under me! I was killed
instantly in a pile of molten shrapnel. “You son of a bitch!” I typed. I
respawned and saw Beafmeat over by the flag, so I machine-gunned him to
the gut until he collapsed. I felt better; justice had been served.

“Teamkiller!” some guy typed, moments before I was sniped in the head by
a teammate from the airfield. I howled in rage and was going to get
revenge, but I saw yet *another* teammate blow apart the sniper with a
bazooka. “Stop the teamkilling!” he said, just moments before someone
ran him over with a jeep and said, “Take that, teamkiller!” Then the
jeep was blown up by one of our tanks, which prompted revenge.

Two minutes later, when the Japanese walked unopposed across the island
and onto our airfield, they were delighted to find twelve American GIs
ignoring them to kill each other in a battle royal. I myself was up on
the roof trying to stab Beafmeat with a knife before he could bazooka
another teammate.

The Newb who started it had long since logged off.
