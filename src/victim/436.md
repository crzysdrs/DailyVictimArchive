  Okay, assuming we take Carl's savings and hock Jim's car, that gives us ... $4200.
  It's a good nest egg, we can build something from that. How much is that in Euros
  again?

Whoa whoa, slow down, don't walk away. I know that my [plan to create
the ultimate *Neverwinter* scenario](@/victim/419.md) turned into an
[unmitigated disaster](@/victim/423.md). But hear me out on this one!
I've got an even BIGGER plan, and this one is foolproof. Mostly.

You guys heard of Vivendi-Universal? Of course you have -- big giant
company fulla Frenchies who own everything. Anyways, I see here in the
New York Times today that [they're going to sell their Games
division](http://web.archive.org/web/20020808000000/http://news.lycos.com/news/story.asp?section=Business&storyId=484702).
Okay, what does that mean for you and me? Well, their games division
includes Universal Interactive but also *Sierra* and *Blizzard*.
Uh-hunh, THAT Blizzard.

So, whoever snatches up that chunk of pie will own ALL the *Diablo*s,
the *Half-Life*s, the *WarCraft*s, the *Empire Earth*s, the *Crash
Bandicoot*s, the *Tribe*s, even Battle.net. I mean, holy CRAP. It would
be like buying an amusement park.

Here, look at the article yourself. Think about it! In just a couple of
weeks, we could swagger into a big board room at Blizzard Entertainment.
I would sit down on a big leather swivel chair at the head of the table
and Bill Roper would stoop down to light my cigar. I'd put my sneakers
up on the marble table, lean back, and announce:

"Okay boys. I want *StarCraft II.* PRONTO!"

Oh, yah, and I'd demand that they give us a bunch of cool *Diablo II*
weapons, just for us. Yeah, and we'd all be moderators on Battle.net so
we can kick people out at will. Oh! And if Sierra was going to publish
the next *Counter-Strike* game I'd demand that we all get Harrier jump
jets. What? What's that?

Well, yeah, of course it's not cheap. But let me tell you in today's
market 1.1 billion Euros is a *steal*. We can raise a billion Euros,
right? I mean, how much is that in Canadian dollars? Hmm. Well, there's
got to be *some* way to raise the money. Who's with me on this one?
