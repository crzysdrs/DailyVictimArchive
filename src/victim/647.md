What? Ubisoft announced a new logo? What a bunch of crap. Corporate
flunkies generating news out of non-events, spamming us with their
nonsense -- let me see that [Web
Page](http://web.archive.org/web/20030911000000/http://ubi.com/US/Articles/news_logo_2003-09-09.htm).
Ah, there's the announcement!

OMG. This is unreal. Get a load of this: "Our new logo is our emblem. It
symbolizes the choices we make every day as a leading publisher and
developer of interactive entertainment â€“ choices based on our vision of
gaming and our assessment of what players want. Just as we stand by each
of our choices, we stand by our logo. The first step toward the future
begins here."

HAHAHaha! Like any self-respecting gamer is gonna buy into that crap.
Let's take a look at that new logo, anyways. There it is ... uh ....

OooOohhh ... that's a ... pretty spiral ... spinning ... spiral ... Ubi
... so soft ...

\[Lengthly, slack-jawed pause.\]

Truly they are a leading publisher and developer of interactive
entertainment. Those of us willing to take that first step into the
future, and stand by our choices, we understand what the new Ubisoft
with the small "s" represents. They have an unwavering vision I can no
longer ignore. Ubisoft is the future. The future is Ubisoft. Must ...
buy ... more copies of Rayman 3 Hoodlum Havoc...
