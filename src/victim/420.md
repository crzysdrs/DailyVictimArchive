\[Part 2 of a 5-part Daily Victim special. [Start at the
beginning](@/victim/419.md)\]

{% css_class(class="left clear") %}
![](/img/victimpics/jul02/ringleader.png) Allright men, listen up! I've
assembled you here because you are the finest artist and AI programmer
in the entire tri-county region! Together [we are about to embark on a
voyage](@/victim/419.md) — both figuratively and culturally! We have
the idea. We have the talent. And now, gentlemen, we have the tools. No
less than ten powerful desktop computers liberated from that Cybercafe
that went out of business, equipped with the finest mice, Wacom tablets,
and networking hardware that city dumpsters can offer. Behind me you can
see this gorgeous roomy VW bus that I borrowed for the week [from a
friend](@/victim/255.md).
{% end %}

My plan in order to beat all the other *Neverwinter* scenarios to the
punch is nothing short of COMPLETE AND TOTAL DUNGEON IMMERSION. I've
rented a cabin far off in the woods over those mountains. It'll take us
all night to drive there and we'll be hours away from humanity,
connected only by a satellite dish modem. We'll do nothing but work on
our world, day in and day out — day by day, night by *Neverwinter*
night. I'm serious: NO OTHER GAMES are allowed on this trip, got it?
Okay, let's look over our essential week-of-the-geek survival gear:

10 computers, 10 keyboards, 10 mice  
 10 19-inch monitors  
 3 plastic Yodas  
 4 power strips  
 1 case of microwave popcorn  
 23 cans of Chef Noodleroni pasta  
 10 copies of *Neverwinter Nights*  
 1 portable radio  
 12 cases of Mountain Dew  
 8 frozen pizzas, assorted toppings  
 1 [Badass Morpheus action figure](@/victim/79.md)  
 6 pounds of Cap'n Crunch  
 1 life-sized cardboard cutout of Princess Amidala, midriff bared  
 48 razor-sharp pencils  
 12 art pens  
 1 book of pr0n — oh, I'm sorry, "anatomy"  
 6 tablets of graph paper  
 1 used Wacom tablet  
 11 cans of soup  
 6 sets of dice  
 1 Monster Manual  
 2 Dungeon Master's Guides  
 3 Player's Handbooks  
 1 Weezer CD  
 12 back issues of Maxim  
 1 network hub, with cables  
 1 enormous angry-clown bong — what — what is this? Who's is this?

Okay, anyways, don’t just stare at the pile! Start packing! It won't
help you to look at the giant pile, then back at the VW, then at the
giant pile, then back at the VW... C'mon, let's do this.

{% css_class(class="left clear") %}
![](/img/victimpics/jul02/aiguy.png) **This cantankerous voyage draws
ever on. When will we reach our destination? My AI minions grow
restless.**  
 Why must we edge ever onwards in this abominable noisebox? My computers
have been unplugged for over six hours. I have not yet determined how my
artificially intelligent NPCs will react to their enforced hybernation.
They've gone several hours of sensory depletion. Shortly before turning
my computer off, the Kobold Captain shuffled toward me and asked if he
would dream. Yes, yes little man. I think you shall.
{% end %}

I wouldn't mind the trip so much if the loathsome long-haired creature
next to me wasn't obsessing about dangling Elven feminine anatomy.

{% css_class(class="left clear") %}
![](/img/victimpics/jul02/artguy.png) **Don't tell the other guys, but I
just couldn't go without other games**  
 I mean it man. I didn't realize this whole *Neverwinter* scenario thing
would be like a game convent. Don't get me wrong, I'm stoked that Dave
is psyched about putting my Elven babes on our website. But I just can't
go a whole weekend without any other games. That's why I've got a Game
Boy Advance hidden inside my angry clown bong. Shhhhh.
