  SHHH! If you're *very* quiet, you can peek through the keyhole and watch Percy at
  work. Hang on. Wait a second. He's watching porno!

I'm ashamed to admit it, but my husband and I couldn't unlock the
special features of the Harry Potter DVD. See, they were hidden behind
all of these special "mini-games" where you had to mix potions or outwit
the three headed dog and stuff. Unreal. Now look, my husband and I
aren't gamers. Sure, we bust out with the insane Windows Solitaire now
and again, but only after we loosen up with a few wine coolers.

So we were forced to call upon one of the neighborhood kids: Percy. The
dark circles around Percy's eyes give him a frightening demeanor but
there's nobody better when you need a game to be solved. "Percy," I told
him. "I'll give you a *dollar* if you unlock the special features on the
Harry Potter DVD for me."

He came back later that day with a broom. He turned off all the lights
in the living room and lit candles instead. He said he needed absolute
silence to do his work.

I'm not really sure what's involved in those little DVD mini-games, but
Percy is *still* in our house. It's been a week and a half. Every so
often he asks for food. My husband and I tiptoe around at night, afraid
to disturb him. I've thought about asking him to leave, but I probably
should've done that during the first couple of days. You know, now that
it's been over a week, it would be awkward.
