Hello, soldier. Before you attempt to charge this bunker, I’d like to
tell you about the sad french horns. You know, the sad french horns that
play every time a soldier dies, and the camera shows his rifle standing
upright in the dirt with his helmet on top? Now, I’m not trying to smack
talk. I’d just like to point out that I am shielded behind a concrete
and sandbag bunker with a hard-mounted machine gun turret. You are
hiding behind a cow corpse at the bottom of a hill. Somewhere – and I’m
not saying where -- a large orchestra is wetting their mouths, making
that puckering face, and raising lots and lots of sad french horns to
their lips in choreographed glimmering bronze unison. Now, ask yourself.
Who are those sad french horns getting ready to play for? Are those sad
sad horns for me? Do I look like a sad horn kinda guy?

I’m not trying to tell you to back off. I just want you to know the
facts. And before you shoulder your rifle, tuck a grenade in your palm,
and hit the voice command menu to shout, “I’m going in…” I want you to
take a moment. And think about those sad, sad horns. Thank you.
