HO baby, I can't wait for [NeverWinter
Nights](http://web.archive.org/web/20010605000000/http://gamespy.com/e3/nwn/).
You can see I've already [plotted out my server's
map](http://web.archive.org/web/20010605000000/http://gamespy.com/articles/june01/neverwinter2/)
on this here sheet of graph paper. Ignore the jelly-smudge, there,
that's not part of the game. You see, I see my server as a sort of
"hub," a place to kick back your steel-toed combat boots and chill
following, you know, bustin' up on other peoples' servers.

Wham, you login here, right next to the Gazebo covered with carvings of
naked Greek dudes and chixx. Now, any time of the night, there's gonna
be people skinny-dippin' in the lake over here, which I have populated
with mermaids. This part over here is like a bitchin' hot tub.

Then we have the casino, with the attached two-car whorehouse. 'Cuz,
like, you jes' spent a hard day 'venturin', am I right? You want to
spend your hard-whacked moolah, ya know? So here you gots your craps and
slots and sluts. Biggity-BAM!!

Now like it's a tradition since Tolkien that the tavern is where the
shit always goes down, so you can see what I have here promises to be
the biggest town tavern on the net. Six floors, eight bars, twelve dance
floors, and 200 varieties of foreign and domestic ale served by greased
up professional wrestlers and peasant chicks.

My server doesn't actually have any dungeons, or monsters, or, uh, plots
or anything. See, you're TIRED of adventuring, you want to take a break,
dig? So you jump through a portal and kerpow, you're getting fresh and
funky with NWN's finest dwarven dudes and elven babes.

It's like a full service server. Over here I put a temple so that after
you're broke you can get forgiven for what you spent your money on, then
you get all blessed up n' stuff before going back onto one of the normal
servers.

Pretty sweet, hunh?
