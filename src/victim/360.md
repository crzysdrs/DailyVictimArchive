Gary. Gary, listen to me. Don't make me shout. Put the arms down. That's
it.

The end of the school year is coming up, and Gary, that means you and I
aren't going to be Juniors anymore. We're officially *Seniors*. And if
you take a look around you, you'll see what most of us already know.
*Seniors don't armpit fart the Mario theme.*

I'll give you this, it floored me in seventh grade. It knocked 'em dead
in ninth grade. It was even, dare I say, a hit with the ladies last
year, when we hooked up the N64 in the AV room and you armpit-farted
along with the game. Becky had cherry soda spurting our her nose. But,
that was your peak man. This whole armpit-fart-mario thing is your own
personal *Who let the Dogs Out*, dude.

No, [*Super Mario
Sunshine*](http://web.archive.org/web/20020506000000/http://www.gamespy.com/previews/may02/mariosunshinegcn/index.shtm)
isn't going to revitalize the whole thing. You will NOT, in fact, "Blow
the roof off that suckah." You will be a grown man, old enough to shave,
standing alone at the prom in the center of the gym floor making your
own sweaty armpits fart to the tune of a video game.
