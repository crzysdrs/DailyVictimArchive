  Some people claim that aliens cheat, but that's simply not the case. Aliens merely
  accuse other players of cheating whenever they are killed. That's what they do.
  They're ALIENS.

Hello, Internet users. My role in the [CIA Black Ops
Division](@/victim/397.md) gives me a unique top-level perspective on
situations that the American public at large has no fluency with.
Recently a unique phenomena has come to our attention. Aliens have begun
to make extensive use of our electronics network. Yes. From their
cloaked orbiting dreadnaughts they've been able to join our Internet
online games. Please, do not be alarmed. Merely be aware that the people
you play games against may not, in fact, be human. Here are some red
flags to look out for:

-   Extraterrestrials have been known to join teamplay servers only to
    kill members of the team they're on. These people are aliens.
-   In online roleplaying games, important items will occasionally spawn
    at long intervals. Players will frequently wait up to sixteen ours
    or more in line in order to get such an item. *No human being would
    willingly submit himself to such tedium.* You must be playing
    with aliens.
-   Internet messageboards are frequently populated
    by extraterrestrials. Lacking a basic grasp of mammalian
    communication, they will often do things like go into an Xbox fan
    group and talk about how much Xbox sucks. They prefer to use guest
    accounts and lots of exclamation points. Yes. *they're aliens*.
-   Many games you know enjoy come from a place called "Canada."
-   Have you ever been playing *Tribes II* and you find that someone set
    up a group of sentry guns off behind your base facing in useless
    directions? That's right. They were placed by *aliens*.
-   Along those lines, aliens will frequently commandeer large vehicles
    and then run over their teammates. They can't help it.
    They're aliens.
-   Anyone who claims absolute fluency with the *Neverwinter Nights*
    editor is clearly from Pluto.

Again, don't be alarmed. Just be wary. Knowing is three quarters of the
battle.
