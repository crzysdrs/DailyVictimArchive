What do you mean "I should give the expansion pack a chance?" Hell no,
this is one sequel I'll pass on. Believe me, I played the original
Panzer Attack Gold Special Forces Edition. I jumped right into the
campaign mode, and by the 700th turn in the El Agheila theatre, I
started noticing all kinds of glitches and flaws.

For example, one time a British ranger threw a fragmentation grenade at
my StuG III from a range of two meters. It registered as a hit on the
front armor, and of course the StuG's 50mm of hull armor was more than
enough to protect the tank. BUT, the front hull of a StuG III slants at
a 69-degree angle, which would've been more than enough to reflect at
least 25% of the shrapnel back at the thrower's unit immediately in
front of the tank. I moused over them and not a single troop registered
so much as a hit. That's ridiculous. That's not REAL war. I might as
well be playing an arcade game.

Later, during the Operation Market Garden campaign, a direct hit on an
allied pillbox with my Panzer IV's 75MM main gun was unable to penetrate
a 20mm thick steel wall at a distance of roughly 200 meters. I mean,
COME ON! Who does the physics for these things, some gradeschooler? It's
packing a 75mm PaK42 L/70 for the love of God! How can you even call
that a "game?"

I think I'll leave the sequel on the shelf, right next to the ridiculous
Wings of Warfare 3: Pacific Theatre expansion -- the one with the
laughable Messerschmitt ME-410 turning radius.
