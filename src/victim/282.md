Many people have brazenly made the claim that they would kill for the
*[Motor City
Online](http://web.archive.org/web/20010824000000/http://gamespy.com/features/firstlooks/motorcity/)*
beta. But I? I actually did it. That's right. Last night, around ten PM,
I killed a man. I won't tell you who, but let's just say that his Chevy
Bel-Air is in much better hands today.

You heard me. *I killed a man.* Earlier he had posted on the forums,
"Hah! You'd have to pry this beta from my cold, dead hands." That was
completely untrue. The beta CD was locked in a desk drawer, nothing that
a good solid ten minutes of kicking couldn't recover. I hate it when
people exaggerate like that.

Yes. You know what I'm saying. I killed to get the *Motor City* beta!
And I'd do it again! Well, not for another beta of *Motor City*. I mean,
I already have it. What I'm saying is, you know, if the beta is good
enough, and I would have to kill to get it, I WOULD! But, you know, I
wouldn't kill frivolously. That's all I'm saying.
