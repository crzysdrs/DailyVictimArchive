  Human Compassion

The Creator stitched my body together from the corpses of over 13
separate Resident Evil victims. Although sound in limb, I lacked one
thing: A human brain.

Unfortunately good human brains are nearly impossible to come by. Of the
several dozen the Creator tried, nearly 20 had "Who Let the Dogs Out?"
running through their head upon installation. At least five others
thought "Biosphere" was one of their all-time favorite movies.

Finally, the Creator opted to use a Playstation 2 for a head. This has
brought me a life of misery. Everything is jaggy, including my scars.

The PS2 launch titles are extremely poor. As you can guess, I am not
into sports games, because I am unable to bend at the knees.
Nevertheless I tried to play SSX, the snowboarding game -- they put me
on top of a mountain, and I toppled over like a brick and slid facefirst
down two vertical miles of ice and snow. When I reached the bottom I was
chased into a castle and burned.

Disheartened, I tried to play Dead or Alive 2. However, I'm not sure
which one I am. My Playstation head is as much a curse to me as the gift
of life itself.

Also, fire bad.
