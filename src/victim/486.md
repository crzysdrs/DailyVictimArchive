blurb: >
  Okay fine. \[Struggling sounds\] Allright, I've got the controller in one hand,
  if I play this round, will someone call the cops? OW! You shot me! You sniping jerk.
  You wait'll I get both hands, smacky. I will wreck you.

Hey -- hey guys? Damn this stupid headset. Uhm, hello? Bunch of random
strangers on the Internet? Yeah, now that the round is over ... can
someone help out? I uh ... Look, I need one of you to log off and call
the *Framingham, Massachusetts Police Department* and send them to my
house, okay? I’ll give you the address.

Okay ... uh, someone say “copy” if you heard me. Guys? Guys, you
listening? Okay ... okay stop trying to teamkill. I need one of you to
send the police to my house.

No! No, I’m NOT camping. I’m ... listen to me ... I’m not lagging out.
I’m ... look, it’s a bit difficult to use the Dual Shock 2 controller
right now, okay? Can someone just get on the telephone and call my local
police? No, I can’t do it myself, I’m on the floor of the living room,
and the only thing within squirming distance is my PS2 and *SOCOM: Navy
Seals* microphone and headset.

Oh, that’s nice guys. Just shoot me while my character is standing there
pleading for help. Oh, what’s that? Oh very nice, put a smoke grenade on
my head. Mnnn. That sure is a hoot, gang. Look at me. Hooting.
