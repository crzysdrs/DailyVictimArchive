  And I bet dad isn't my dad, either. Unless he got me that minibike. In which case,
  he still may not be my dad, but I won't quibble in the details. Ciao baby!

Mother? This videogame you bought me for my birthday -- it's not *SSX*
for the Playstation 2. I asked for *SSX*. What we have here is
*Coolboarders*. While both games are in fact snowboarding titles,
*Coolboarders* is not *SSX*. In fact, *Coolboarders* is to *SSX* as the
Muppets are to Congress.

This is an egregious mistake. It leads me to conclude that you're not my
real parents. My life is a total sham. I was adopted. My real parents
were probably burned in a fire and are likely buried in a mausoleum with
a copy of *SSX* clutched in their blackened bony hands as we speak.

It's tragic, woman-who-was-once-my-mom, but it's probably true.
