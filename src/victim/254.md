I'm serious guys. We're all in this fraternity together, and that means
we share beer, we share chicks, and we share Bryan's PS2 (whether he
likes it or not.) But I woke up this morning, er, maybe more correctly
'this afternoon,' and I discovered that somebody -- a fellow Theta Chi
no less -- VIOLATED me. My PS2 memory card is gone. The orange one,
helpfully labelled "Scooter Shizzat?" GONE!

Far be it from me to accuse my brothers of something so treacherous, but
I can't help but think that this is related to this weekend's massive
campus-wide *Gran Turismo 3* tourney. I'm on a crusade to *dominate*
this racing game. As you know, I've spent the last two weeks cutting
Schwartz's Calc 2 class in order that I can play simulation mode
uninterrupted here, and in that time I've managed to tweak up my
lime-green Honda Del Sol to the point where it leaves twin streaks of
flame on the starting line, Back-to-the-Future style. I plan not only to
go all the way, but to look good doing it, in convertable comfort. Now,
my memory card, my Del Sol, and my chance to go all the way with both
the tourney and Susie French are all *missing*, and it had to be one of
your guys.

What's the matter? Can't take the heat? Was it you, Nards? Howabout you
Flattop? Skidz? Wetbed? Beemer? Wanker? Chango? C'mon guys, own up! You
don't want those [rich turds from pre-law](@/victim/257.md) or [that
freaky dude in the VW bus](@/victim/255.md) to win the tourney, do
you? You leave me no choice. I'll have to order up a full-on pants-drop
so the search can begin. You hear me? OWN UP OR DROP TROU! Hey -- HEY,
you pulled that fire alarm on purpose! Come back here! I'm telling you,
*I'm gonna find that card!*

\[*Gran Turismo 3 Week begins at the Daily Victim! One week of hardcore
racing, backstabbing, and smack talk culminating in the big tournament
this weekend. Which victim will win? Stop by all week to vote.*\]
