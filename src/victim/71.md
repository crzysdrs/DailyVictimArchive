Please, put down your weapons!

I am but a humble texture artist! It's true that I lend my services on a
contract basis to the fine fine people at Verant Interactive, the makers
of EverQuest, but I swear to the allmighty that I had nothing to do with
what they did to the Manastone!

That's right, I just make textures! That new armor you're wearing in the
expansion? I drew that! I did! You have me to thank! But the Manastone,
please, do not blame it on me. I am innocent!

While it is true that I was in the offices that day, I was not present
at the meeting where they decided that the manastone wouldn't work in
the planes or in the new expansion packs. I was getting a soda and
browsing through a source-art booklet of medieval chainmail armor
practices. I was innocently drinking a Wild Cherry Pepsi, and
contemplating ringmail, by the grace of God! I had nothing to do with
the atrocities committed by my superiors!

Honest Injun!

Oh please, please don't put me in the trunk of the car. Someone tried
that after they Nerfed the gnomes, too, and Verant has a strict policy
on not paying off employee ransoms, even if all they ask for are Boxes
of Abu-Kar.
