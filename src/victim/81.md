So he comes into the computer lab — I dunno who, one of those eggheads
who works all day under the library — he comes in and — no, I don't
know if it was Mark's friend, shut up and let me tell the story — he
comes in and I show him my computer screen. And he's like, WHOA! And he
brushes me aside and sets his Snapple down on my notes (left a ring) and
starts hitting buttons. I think for sure he's on the case, right? But
no, a couple seconds later he walks over to the printer and picks up a
few pages it spit out.

"Wait'll the guys see THIS one!" he says. Then, you know, he's headed
out of there. I'm like, "Dude! What am I supposed to do?" and so he
says, "Oh, dunno man. Turn it off and back on or something. But if I
were you I'd keep it there and leave it for the next guy to see."

Yeah, then he left. What do you mean, what did I do? I left it on there.
Duh. Yeah, this morning I saw photocopies of my computer screen taped up
on all the bulletin boards in the Biology building.
