Whaddyou talkin' about, "take it easy, lil' man?" I'll take it easy when
I log off this server, you leather-coated trollbanger. Shaddup and fork
over the ALE!

I donna have a drinkin' problem. It all goes in my mouth, and the rest
goes on my beard fer later. Shut the yap trap 'fore I stuff a flaginnin
it.

\[Belches loudly.\]

See here, this whole game is littered wis booze. Every tavern you go
into, liquor on everrry table. Every house, liquor in everrry cabinet.
Liquor, liquor, liquor.

They oughta've called this game "Neversober nights."

Thas right, I'm done with that tankard, I need ANOTHER. A bigger one.
MEAD, WENCH!! I've NOT had too mush. God you're so FAT. Thas what thisis
about isinit? You. A fatty. Fat butt. You godda wiggle into that
chainmail one cheek at a time doncha sister? I'm not an angry drunk,
imma nan honest drunk. So just hook me up wit another drink fore I lose
this axe between those massive foldsa flab you're packin' in the trunk,
sweetheart. You heard me!!

Gawd, why doesn't someone straghtsen UP this tavern anywayzsses? These
tables'reall CROOKED. I'll sit downcuz I waNNA sit down. Adventurers
SUCK.

\[The angry dwarf is suddenly very morose, his head dangling limply over
the table, dribbling.\]

Itscuzza mom-n-dad back in the diamond mines. *I NEVER LEARNED TA
LOVE!!*

\[Could the angry dwarf be weeping?\]
