Now we're ... ungh ... gonna need to move the China Cabinet into the
garage I think but -- Mmph! Could you give me a hand with this? Whew!

What are you talking about? This is *absolutely* neccessary. Whenever I
defend the base, it's important that I can hear even the slightest
muffled footstep coming through the rear entrance so I can turn around
and rip off a rocket -- otherwise, I'm less of a man.

Also, when I blow up some chump with a grenade? There's really nothing
in it for me unless photos are flung from the wall like an air raid. I
want to be lifted off of my chair. I want to dislodge ceiling tile. I
want to make sure I never need to clean the gutters ever again.

I want the damn Wilson family down the road to hear it everytime I get
an ICQ. Otherwise, they might not know how popular I am. Ideally, their
windows will crack with the low rumbling roar of an incoming file
transfer -- that was, you know, my New Year's resolution.

Later tonight I hired some movers to help me lift the subwoofer out from
the back of the pickup truck.
