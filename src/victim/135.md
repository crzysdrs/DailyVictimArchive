For over a year I've been running the fastest, most reliable UT server
on the net. But it was all part of my master plan! A false sense of
reliability! When those poor bastards logged in this afternoon, sure,
there was a new map to download and some changes to the server, but they
probably thought nothing of it. Until they started to play. Mwa-haha!

So here's this guy firing the shock rifle. He keeps pulling the trigger
and hearing the sound effect, but he can't see any results. Little does
he suspect that I've coded the shock rifle to *FIRE BEAMS OUT OF HIS
ASS!* Watch him turn around, confused, to discover that he just mowed
down six of his teammates! Ho ho HOOO!

Try as they might, his teammates can't warn him because all team-chat
messages go to the opposite team.

Oh no, that blue guy has made the mistake of pressing the "Gravity
Eraser Button." OH LOOK AT THE ANTICS! Well, fortunately many of them
will survive the whirling blades that I've put on the ceiling, but not
many will survive the ensuing fall when the gravity randomly turns back
on.

Any moment they'll discover the "fill the level with lava" button. Oh
well, if they don't, it'll happen anyway as soon as someone foolishly
picks up the redeemer. JUST LOOK AT THEIR FACES!!
