That's right, prior to *Global Operations*, these first-person shooting
games required natural-born "Kommandants" like myself to be right up on
the front lines like the enlisted men. This was a problem because
handling a weapon requires the so-called "skillz" that men of rank like
myself don't possess. And you know, half those games don't let you type
to the other players once you die. How was I supposed to command the men
in that condition?

But *Global Ops* is a different story. I can sign up for the "Intel"
class and demonstrate my natural leadership skillz. I get a map, and all
my little men -- most of which I consider disposable for the cause --
are shown as little arrows. Like any good leader, I can click on them
and them tell them what to do. Watch:

"Shoot that guy! You! Run up and shoot that other guy! Now -- you! You,
go and ... shoot ... that guy! What are you doing? Are you guys not
shooting ... the guys? Okay, fine. You! Shoot! The Guy! Aw crap."
