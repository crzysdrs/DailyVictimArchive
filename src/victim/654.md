  Oh great, it just clomped dead. Now I have to watch *My Big Fat Greek Wedding* like
  the rest of the mindless drones on this big flying bus.


  ....could I have those peanuts though?

Look at this flickering red battery light, it's like it's about to wink
out here and now. And where are we? Still another 20 minutes from
approach? We should be approaching! You go up there and tell that stupid
Captain to make with the approachation! Either that, or hook me up with
some double-A's, PRONTO, because this beeyotch is about to go down and
when it does I'm taking this whole plane with me! Don't you see I'm in
the middle of an extremely tense *Final Fantasy Tactics* battle? That's
right, you go tell the other "hostesses."

\[Frantically hits the "call" button over and over\]

Hello? Does the Captain have any updates for me or Rene the Moogle
Knight? My music is starting to stutter. NO, I DON'T WANT A SEDATIVE.
Well, okay, maybe a couple. And get me one of those tiny pillows. Things
are getting *really* serious here.

\[Jams on the "call" button again and again\]

What did the captain just mean "headwind?" Are headwinds good or bad?
When I look down out the windows I see little dots. I should see big
dots. Or a tarmac. I just see little dots. And now clouds. Are we in the
clouds? Clouds aren't the ground! This Game Boy is gonna be TOAST any
moment! Did you explain that to the captain? Did you tell him about the
little red battery light? About how it's almost out? Did you?

I DON'T WANT A PEANUT.
