Allow me to elaborate.

**1. Of Hostages and Breathing**  
 Legs apart, stretch, that's it. Exhale with each movement ... yesss,
yes... I learned this on the Internet. Exhale when you fire your glock.
Reloading? Inhale. Breathe in ... snipe ... breathe out. Tap the
hostage. Soothing, calming, clicking of the use key ... that's right.
Breathe in, run backwards firing the AK. Breathe out. Focus, focus.

**2. Of Mouse Sensitivity and the Yang Style**  
 The Chinese characters for Tai Chi Chuan can be translated as the
"Supreme Ultimate Force." It is the AWP of the martial arts. The secret
to Tai Chi is the flow. Each of the many forms are accomplished slowly,
softly and gracefully with smooth and even transitions. The best way to
do this is with a mouse sensitivity of 16.

**3. Grasping the Sparrow's Tail: Disarming the Bomb in Harmony**  
 The unplanted bomb is far more beautiful than that which has been
armed. Hear the beeping, clense, clense. Breathe deeply. The wise man
carries tools. With them, draw back the bow to shoot the tiger, but make
sure your teammates cover your back with the precision of the jade lady
who works the shuttles.

During the loading screens between maps, clap your hands and rub them
together like Mr. Miagi does in Karate Kid. Oh ... that's not Tai Chi or
anything, I just think it's cool.
