You heard me loud and clear. Need I say it again? 'cuz I will. That's
all I gotta say. One word: *Halo*.

Hang on what? No, seriously, what? What are you all gettin' up into with
all that? I said before, *Halo.*. That's all I'm sayin'. One word.
That's all. That's what it is.

You want more? You want to know more? Correct me if I'm wrong, but I
told you all you need to know. One word, baby: HALO.

Nuff said.

Dude. You're still talking. I said nuff, nuff said. NUFF. Nuff not nuff
for you?

I see, I see. Okay, allow me to retort. One word, one word only: *Halo*.
All that needs to be said.

So that's all I'm sayin'.

Halo.

Nuff said.
