I first noticed the problem a couple months ago, as bit by bit the
output from my laser printer started to fade. Pretty soon the center of
any printed page contained a white stripe of nearly unreadable text.
That would never do!

Did you know that printers use magical powder called "Toner" to make the
words appear all wordy? It's TRUE. I discovered the secret when I
"opened" my printer "up" and found a "Toner Cartridge."

But where does toner come from? How do I get more? And, more
importantly, where can I find HIGH-QUALITY, LOW-COST printer and Fax
Supplies that EXCEED MANUFACTURER'S SPECIFICATIONS at WHOLESALE PRICES
THAT WON'T LAST? For *weeks* and *weeks* I agonized over this perplexing
conundrum. Then, one day, I was checking my email, and *there it was!*

Out of the blue someone must've heard about my problem and emailed me an
OUTSTANDING OFFER. "Friend" they called me. WOW. You bet I am! I ordered
hundreds of dollars worth of supplies, then gave them the email
addresses to all my friends to make sure that nobody misses out on this
incredible deal.
