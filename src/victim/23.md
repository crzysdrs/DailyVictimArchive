  Look, I don't really care to comment about your stupid votes and my score. Fact
  is, I've got my Level 36 mage mastering his war magic in the middle of the direlands
  and if I don't get back soon he's -- oh look, my pager went off. Ciao!

I'm glad we can finally get this out onto the table. Ever since I moved
into the cubicle across from yours and surrounded it with an
inpeniterable tent of army-surplus camouflage netting, you've constantly
tried to crane your neck over the divider to see what I've been working
on. Yes, without fail I've been logged into Asheron's Call, "working" on
my Level 36 mage.

I don't want to give you the impression that I somehow 'lucked out' or
'breezed into' this job. Au Contraire. I created this situation for
myself using careful career maneuvering and months of planning. I
studied your pathetic corporate structure like the Twink I am, plotting
and scheming over Jolt Cola and coffee each and every day, every time I
was given another droll assignment.

But three weeks ago I was promoted -- or perhaps we can say laterally
advanced -- or more accurately demoted -- down to your stinkhole next to
the mailroom, and cleverly pointed out to my superiors the importance of
maintaining two mission-critical computer systems that you and I both
know require at most 30 minutes of maintenance a week. I also made sure
that the organizational chart reflected that I was under the authority
of both Kramden and Dobbs, as well as being the primary assistant to a
position that has not yet been filled. Everyone simply assumes that I'm
working hard for somebody ELSE, and I put in tons of late hours to prove
it. I'm flying under the corporate radar like a modern day stealth
bomber.

Whenever they drag my stinking corpse into one of their inane manager
meetings, I always scurry in moments before it starts, purposefully
unkempt. Then I arrange for my pager to go off several minutes into the
meeting, and I mumble something about the servers and rush frantically
out of the room.

If I time it right, I'm in and out of the meeting before my Asheron's
Call character is logged out due to inactivity. I'm that good.
