Hey hey! What up, Flavor Flav? Note my new PaRappa the Rapper chains,
decisive proof that U CAN'T TOUCH ME!

Oh, who am I kidding? Confidence is at an all time low. Earlier this
week I was in the Software Store and I saw [this dreamy woman score a
copy of *Freedom Force*](@/victim/332.md), even though it had
supposedly been sold out. To say I fell in love was an understatement.
I'd found an angel in tight pants. She wasn't only beautiful -- she was
a *gamer!* How was I supposed to win over the heart of a girl like that?

For inspiration, I turned to my idol, PaRappa the Rapper for the
PlayStation. I realized that all I needed was mad rhythm! And, maybe
these PaRappa the Rapper chains. What do you think? Do they make me look
cool? I was thinking of showing up under her window tonight and
"busting" some phat groovies. Like this:

My tight pants honey!  
 You're so money!  
 &nbsp; You get my Metal Gear Solid  
 &nbsp; You get my Deus so Ex-rated  
 I loves you a ton-ny!

I'm passion's creator  
 I'm a love...  
 ...Liberator!

So what do you think? C'mon guys, really. When you're done pointing at
me and laughing, let me know. It's the chains, isn't it? I GOTTA
BELIEVE!
