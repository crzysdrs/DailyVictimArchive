HEY! You! [Stupid neighbor kid and your dumb puppy](@/victim/82.md)
-- GET OFF MY LAWN! Okay, this is the LAST STRAW! You know what I'm
going to do? I'm going to rig up my yard with hundreds of game CDs
attached to volatile spring-loaded steel tension cables.

Oh sure, hide in your snow fort and mock me. You see the tattered
remains of this Half-Life CD? [It killed over six dozen people at my
office](@/victim/76.md), one of which was disemboweled even though he
was hiding in a refrigerator. He died not of wounds but of asphyxiation
when the soda pop all around him exploded. *And the same could happen to
you!*

That's right, I'm going to booby-trap my yard with hundreds of game CDs
that I [ganked from work](@/victim/75.md), just like the GeForce card
I gave my kid for Christmas. This copy of Red Alert 2? I'm going to wrap
it around these two trees, around the satellite dish, through the tires
of my wife's car, and finally prop it into place between the knees of my
lawn flamingo. If your stupid puppy so much as *nudges* this
spring-loaded cable in an attempt to yellow any more of my snow, that
sucker's gonna cut loose like Sherman through Georgia. Soon the merest
stray puppy-paw will unleash dozens of screaming aluminum resin-coated
harbingers of death, flashing through the air like Ginsu knives! The
newfallen snow will be covered with the blood and entrails of a thousand
vermin!

Believe me, [I've seen the apocalypse](@/victim/76.md), and the
howling maw of armageddon is no place for chocolate doe-eyed puppy-dogs.
