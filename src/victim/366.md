  using NoFlare it is inappropriate to stare directly at the sun, although, frankly,
  it's kinda fun.\]

You've treated your car windows with U.V. protectant -- why not your PC
monitor?

It's a proven fact that ever since the "lens flare" effect was
discovered in the late '90s, it's been appearing in just about every
outdoor scene in every video game. More and more you can't run your
character toward the sun without a bothersome flaring effect obscuring
your crosshairs, powerups, and more. WHAT'S A GAMER TO DO?

That's where I step in. Give me 30 minutes with your monitor and I'll
coat it with my special patent-pending monitor-tinting film. No more
sunglasses, no more sunscreen.

True, you WILL have to adjust the brightness and contrast of your
monitor afterwards as darkened rooms will have become completely
invisible BUT heed my words friend, never again will eye-jarring
lens-flare destroy your gaming experience!

Order today and de-flare your monitor for only $19.95!!(\*)

<span style="font-size:80%;">\* Pricing based on 14" monitor. Larger
monitors will require extra fees.</span>
