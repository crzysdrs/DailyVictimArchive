You'd best be all backing slowly up and puttin' down the chairs and golf
clubs, right? 'Cuz this baby is a Swingline, and I've shot a staple a
good thirty feet with this puppy. So ... we're going to chill, am I
right?

I can see you were all a little upset with my latest cost-saving
measure, but have you seen the papers lately? That's right, everyone's
going out of business. And small companies like ours just can't afford
all those luxuries, particularly the Internet.

\[There's a rush of bodies and the sound of a stapler firing -- people
drop to the floor, howling...\]

BACK OFF! BACK OFF or I'll plug another! All I did was terminate our
office dual-T1 connection. We still have Internet, just not broadband.
Two 56K modems should be plenty of bandwidth for a 200-person Internet
consultation firm.

None of you jackasses even noticed the change until this afternoon at
5:00 when you all tried to fire up your nightly Tribes games! Ha ha ha

\[Transcript dissolves into sound of furniture flying, staples slamming
into drywall, the trample of footsteps, screaming and mayhem.\]
