  Look, you're going to have to talk to the other side of my face, at least until
  my human fishes around and finds my missing button eye. Wait ... hang on a moment
  ... WHERE IS HIS OTHER HAND!?

Gentlemen, thank you for meeting with me today.

Again I wish to humbly apologize for the actions of my human on the
night of August 14th, where, during a moment of my inattention, he
hacked into your company's webserver and replaced your product catalog
with a crudely Photoshopped X-rated photo of Britney Spears annotated
with the phrase "TRIBES ROOLZ."

In the future I'll be more attentive during his "computer time,"
ensuring that he sticks to harmless activities such as email, video
games, or chasing about that little kitty screensaver.

I humbly ask that you do not press charges on my human. His primitive
mammalian brain cannot possibly comprehend the ramifications of his
actions. Also, please direct all of your correspondance to me, Raggedy
Polly Mop-top. Who's a pretty girl? Who's a pretty, pretty girl? Crap, I
just lost an eye.

Thank you for your time.
