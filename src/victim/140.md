Look, you know how I get when someone touches my stuff, and here's my
stuff, and it's definitely been *touched.* Last night when I left, the
little one-inch tall plastic Indian I have here was standing on my
monitor pointing his little blue rifle over toward the entrance to the
coffee break room -- you know, just in case. And this morning I came in
and he's clearly -- *CLEARLY* -- facing toward the water cooler *next*
to the coffee break room. As if *that* makes any sense.

Yes it's a big deal! To move my Indian, someone would've had to actually
walk into my *cubicle*, which I posted on the bulletin board was totally
off limits. Then, you know, what was he doing? Touchin' my Indian?
Moving my things -- why? WHY WOULD YOU MOVE THE INDIAN? Was someone
inspecting him? Fondling my native? Sliding him through wet exposed
underarm hair? It could happen!

No, I can't get back to work. Everytime I look up I see the Indian has
been moved. I tried to move him back but it's just not the same. Don't
people undersand I put him there for a *reason*? People don't just stick
little blue plastic Indian toys that they found onto their PC monitors
willy-nilly, is all I'm saying. No, no, just go away! I don't need your
help.

I need some private time with the Chief.
