Damn Charlie, you gotta cut that stuff out! You're ... you keep playing
that *Spider-Man* game, you're gonna give that whole BIZNESS away! The
movie ain't out for another week.

Gimmie that CD -- no, gimmie -- GIMMIE! I'm just gonna put it back in
the jewel case and then I'm gonna hide it up here on the top of the
shelf behind the Boba Fett-head bank. Look here, see, next time you be
gettin' the urge to go and spoil the movie ol' Boba-head here is gonna
give you the evil eye. That's right. You don't be messin' with the
Boba-head.

Isn't that better? Now we don't know nothin' about the movie. See? It'll
be a total surprise. We don't know anything about Peter Parker. We don't
know how he gets his spider powers. We don't know how he meets Kirsten
Dunst. We don't know who Kirsten Dunst is. We don't know if Kirsten
Dunst gets it on. We don't know if there's a delicious Kirsten Dunst
nude scene. Kirsten Dunst topless. Kirsten Dunst in slinky neglige with
a slit up to her thigh. We don't know ... Oh SCREW YOU BOBBA let's put
the CD in!
