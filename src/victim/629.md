What *is* this? Diplomats of the old republic? No, it's *KNIGHTS!* and
Knights are defined as "People who kill stuff." That's why I say: Less
talking and more Light Sabering!

Don't you hear that? A Sith Fleet is attacking! I'm not interested in
your interpersonal nuances. No, I don't want to rescue anyone. Why are
my hands empty? There is nothing in my hands. There should be a light
saber in each one, and I should be swinging them at droids and faceless
dudes who will clatter to the ground by the hundreds before my withering
assault.

Now I'm looking in crates. What's in this crate? A repair kit? Parts?
Garbage like all the other crates? What I'm hoping to find is a light
saber, as well as a ticket to the planet of AssKickWithSaberia.

Okay, now wait. Who are you? Hello, now you're going to tell me all
about energy shields. That's great, sure, just chatter away Mr. NPC,
talk talk talk talk. If, of course, by "Energy Shields," you mean,
"Light Sabers." And by "activating" them, you mean "Swing then
indiscriminately at Sith warlords." No? Then STOP WITH THE TALKING!

Rwwaarhh! Jedi ANGRY! Jedi want KILL now!
