Why, yes sir, as a matter of fact I *do* have a Doctor's note, right
here.

Yeah, it was a pretty rough evening all told, sir. See, I couldn't get a
date that night because of [My Stupid Roommate's Asheron's Call
Addiction](@/victim/59.md), so instead I was taking on all
challengers at [Madden
2001](https://web.archive.org/web/20001209000000/http://www.sportplanet.com/features/reviews/madden2001/ps2/).

Along comes this guy from hallway 3B, right? Now, I'm the king of the
lateral pass, I'm unstoppable, so confidence is high. Then this guy
parks his ass on the beanbag next to me, and holy crap, you should've
seen his hand. No, his hand. I'm serious, [this guy's right hand was
abnormally huge](@/victim/67.md). He called it "The Hand." It
*engulfed* the whole PS2 controller.

I started to feel the fear, you know? But I couldn't show it! I had to
stay strong, stay strong — strong like Shaft. I'm the biggest free
agent on my dorm floor. "*Show me the money!*" I shouted, "*Show me the
money!*" Then during the third quarter I made this one reception and ...
Oh jezes ... He hit the X button so hard I got pounded into the turf
like a tent peg. It took a fifth of Vodka and half an Orbital album to
revive me.

No no, I'll be fine, but when I came to the doctor told me to stay away
from long lectures or deskwork. It's all here in the paperwork. Yeah —
the pink copy is yours, But I'll need the yellow copy to give to the
guys at the office.
