  Right, so that's decided! Now, I need to determine what shoes I'm going to wear
  for the master's tournament. Man, this is one HARD golf game.

Once you're this deep into playing your golfer in *Tiger Woods PGA Tour
2004*, you're committed. I've invested a lot of time into this guy. A
lot of tours. I'm challenging the big guys now. I'm always on the
fairway. I've got sponsors like Puma, Tag Heuer, and Target's Lingerie
department.

So now, at this critical juncture in my career, I've got to ask myself:

Should I go with the Du-Rag?

This is EA Sports, and you know, it wouldn't be in the game unless it
was in the game. I have to think about my fans, and my sponsors. I have
to consider how it would look during commercials on ESPN.

Whoa, slow down. Let's not even get INTO the COLOR of the Du-Rag. That's
heavy stuff -- you'd think blue, to match the sweatervest I bought for
this tour, but I might go with red to match the jersey I was planning to
wear during the next tournament. That's going to be a heavy, heavy
decision, but I don't want to even go there yet. Right now, I just need
to focus, consider my options, and then answer the pivotal question:

Do I do the Du?

I think I'm going to have to put the game down and think about this for
a while. C'mon, let's go have some raspberry lemonade down at the
clubhouse -- and by clubhouse I mean the futon by the kitchen. I've got
a lot to think about.

*What would Tiger do?*
