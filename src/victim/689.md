  I can't even pronounce this next word, it looks like you started to say "turtle"
  and made it into a compound word with "mole-lancing" and then something in latin
  that I had to look up.

No, you'll just have to put it away and play something else, something
that won't be as offensive. Like *Grand Theft Auto*. Why?

Have you ever *listened* to yourself play *Mario Kart?* You're not the
man I married once you climb into that big turtle. By the time you
powerslide around the first turn your mouth opens up and a stream of
vulgarity pours out, uninterrupted by a single breath, until you cross
the finish line with a purple face and veins bursting from your neck.

It's not just that you're swearing, Haden. You're putting together
combinations of words in disturbing, almost mathematically offensive
patterns. You're inventing new words that sound worse than real words.
Hell, you invent new *concepts* that are disturbing on such a basic
moral level that I've decided there should've been 12, or possibly 13
commandments in the Old Testament to cover for the additional scenarios
you've invented while playing as Luigi.

You don't believe me? Hang on, I actually wrote down a quote from your
last session. Let me unfold the piece of paper here... Okay, here it is:

"You \[expletive\] Princess \[expletive\]," I quote, "I'm gonna take
that \[expletive\] shell and ram it sideways up \[expletive\] until your
\[expletive\] sprouts a new \[expletive\] and \[expletive\] your" --
now, I think this next word is "Peachpit," followed by "eboli," and then
you made the sign of the devil and yelled
"\[expletive\]bananarama\[expletive\] up in this \[expletive\],
bi-yotch." Did I spell By-yotch right?

I think the kids would be safer if you played something more innocent,
like *Manhunt.*
