blurb: >
  Know ye, now, Schumacher? Glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally intolerable
  truth; that all deep, earnest thinking is but the intrepid effort of the soul to
  keep the open independence of her sea; while the wildest winds of volleyballs conspire
  to cast her on the treacherous, slavish bench? Dammit.

How the balls whip about me! Were I a volleyball I'd hurl no more myself
upon such a miserable gym class, it tubular-necked jocks and their
bullet heads hurling their vengeance upon the meek -- how our poor
hearts throb, our poor brains beat too much. And ye with your vile
throws have ventilated it such; blown ere between these ears and
bloodied my nose on the basketball court floors as lava from vesuvius.

Out now with it! The last ball is upon me, and stand I alone against
Bobby Schumacher with abs aplenty. In ev'ry fight hurl the survivors the
last and bitterest blow, before the eyes of the bleacher'd masses
yearning for a caught ball to send them free, an outrage among the
mortal thrower and his weaken'd arm before he alone must sit down
against the maelstrom. About, about! Come down all of ye, for into the
open maw I prepare to to hurleth my spiteful sphere, baptis'd in mine
own blood!

Forehead to forehead I meet thee, Bobby Schumacher. But let me have one
more good round look aloft here at my period three Gym Class; there's
time for that. Aye, not changed a wink since I first saw it, took a
softball pitch to mine crotch as the s'mester began. Now, to you,
Schumacher. I grin at thee, thou grinning jock! Oh oh!

I turn my body from the sun! Towards thee I roll, thou owning but
unconquering foo! To the last I grapple with thee! From Hell's heart I
stab at thee! For hate's sake I hurl my last dodgeball at thee!
Aaiieeeghhh!!

\[The thunderous thump of a dodgeball pounding against clattering wooden
bleachers echoes through the gymnasium.\]

Crap.
