  ......NO! I just can't do it. I'm going to go out and buy a second 80GB hard drive.
  That'll keep me going for *at least* two months.

What? No space available on Drive C:? It's amazing how quickly 80GB goes
nowadays. No problem, I'll just empty my recycle bin. That got me...
three megabytes. Hmm. I've got a long way to go.

I'll have to delete some of these old programs. Let's see here ...
*Baldur's Gate II*? No WAY! When I last played it two months ago I just
made it through that ridiculously hard Planar Sphere level. God as my
witness, I will someday finish that game. Someday. Same with
*Morrowind*. Those are staying.

Let's see, that brings us to *SimCity 4*. No way I'm deleting that! I'd
lose Slumsburg, and Hovelton. I spent hours building those. Or my
favorite, the big metropolis known as "Fat Jack's Whorehouse Crack
City." I have a high-speed rail line [linking it to My
Anus](@/victim/561.md), thanks to my roommate's city naming schemes.
No, *Sim City 4* stays.

Of course I've got to keep *Battlefield 1942*. It would take hours of
downloading and installing to reinstall all the mods I've put on that
thing. Same with ... uh ... *Half-Life*. And all three *Quake* games,
which are still on here. No sir, they're going to stay.

Wow. Damn. I guess there's nothing left to do but to start deleting my
21 gigs of adult movies. Technology = pain.
