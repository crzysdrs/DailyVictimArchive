Editor -

Might I bring to your attention the ingestion of this so-called "Hot
Sauce?" As a spy-oriented gaming fan site, you should be well aware of
what's come to be known as the "Lan Party," where groups of individuals
coalesce around a network hub to competitively play interactive
entertainment products or "games."

Often the best way to nourish these compatriots is to furnish them with
Italian deliverables, "pizza" if you will. But second to that is a run
to nearby take-out establishments of the Mexican persuasion. Here, it is
possible to order a "macho" burrito, which contains over one pound of
pure, unadulterated beef.

But to the point at hand. I witnessed with my own eyes my LAN-going
friends dumping packet after packet of a so-called "Hot Sauce" onto
their macho burrito under the presumption of contributing to the
flavorvality of the victuals. To my astonishment, closer inspection
revealed that the liquid contained in the packets was neither "hot" NOR
a "sauce," in the conventional sense of the word! It was merely a
reddish sort of "liquid!"

Why? WHY for God's sake WHY!?! WHY do we EAT this so-called HOT SAUCE!?
For what PURPOSE do we MAINTAIN this charade!? And when, WHEN, I ask,
will it STOP!?

Sincerely,  
 Dan "HotSauce" Melberg

P.S. Please withold my name, they might spit in my food. Thanks.
