You say bumping me from the 500-point monkey target down onto the
10-point platform was an accident, eh Jace? Like the time you
"accidentally" bumped me off of the launch ramp in the first round?
Don't think I can't read the dark thoughts lurking in your oblong
primate head! I tell you the TRUTH, for the remainder of this Monkey
Target round, I'm adopting a policy of SCORCHED EARTH!

That's right. My little baby monkey is closing his ball and opening the
whupass, to turn a phrase. While, to date, I've been calmly and
diplomatically coasting to a good cruising speed and then dropping
gently onto the target area with my Super Monkey Ball, this time around
I am gunning for nothing short of the weeping. You want the monkey? YOU
CAN'T HANDLE THE MONKEY.

Forget the bananas, Jace. You can *have* the bananas. I'm gonna circle
above the target and wait for you to land, then I'm closing my ball and
I'm coming down on you like a SIMIAN TORPEDO. That's right. I'm planning
on leaving a crater. But not before hitting *your* monkey so hard it's
HEAD WILL SPIN! Well, more so than normal, at the very least.

So, to summarize: Weeping, scorched earth, no bananas, simian torpedo,
spinning heads. In fact, I've prepared a PowerPoint presentation. DIM
THE LIGHTS, PLEASE!
