Yo Readers! Since it's taken forever to relaunch the site I thought I'd
give you an update about what's happening here in the land of the
victimized. The problem turned out not so much to be finding a new
artist (I've got the man. And I mean that: he's the man. I don't just
mean he's a man, as opposed to a horse.)

The real issue is getting the feature compatible with the new GameSpy
site, which now runs under a content management system. The old victim
code, with its custom voting script and other goodness, doesn't play
nice with our new systems. You can still check out the archives. But the
new site ... well, I had to get some more people involved. It's taken
forever. My bad. Should you see me in the street, you're welcome to kick
me in the gut as payback.

That said, I've got stories written, and I've got a cast of characters
together that'll make the new feature really stand out. I think you'll
like it. Expect results shortly after I get back from vacation in July.
Meet the new crew!
