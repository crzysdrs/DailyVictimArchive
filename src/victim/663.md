  and stuff he thinks he's so HOT. Well, let's see HIM handle Beggar's Canyon!

I'm perfect for your job, sir. I've got an MBA. Well, not one of your
hoity-toity ones, with the "diploma" and stuff. Only three months of
play and already I have my degree. See, the *Star Wars Galaxies* MBA
program is a cost-effective course because the entire program is done
online. You take a small entrepreneurial blaster craftsperson, like
myself, and you get very "hands-on." That is to say, I ran my own
business. In *Galxies*.

I had to worry about all the things that regular businesspeople have to
worry about in the real world. You know, the supply chain. Labor.
Quality of parts. Cost of goods. Jawas. Rent. Marketing. T&E. Sandpeople
attacks. The usual.

I can see you're a man of action, and a strong leader, because you're
calling security. But I assure you I have the skills to handle your
sales operation. Did I mention I ran the cash register at Dennys?

Okay, fine, usher me out of the building. You just wait until I'm a
Jedi! I'll kick your ass without even moving my foot
