Okay, I have to get something off my chest -- er, I mean “YAARRR ME
MATIES! I’ve a mainbrace to splice with ye!”

Yeah, this whole “September 19th: Talk Like a Pirate Day” is killing my
team’s ability to defend the map in *Battlefield 1942*. Communication is
so KEY in these games, and once these guys got their peglegs on we could
barely hoist the mizzenmast. Much less a flag.

It goes like this, right: I’m holding down the bridge on the Market
Garden map and suddenly I get an urgent radio message from Long John
Boba: “YARRR me buckos, the scurvies keelhauled me Dinghy port o’ the
poop deck!”

Now, does he mean that the Nazis stole his tank west of the church? Or,
does he mean they took the flag on the bridge to the left of town? I’m
not really sure, and nobody will answer me unless I talk like a pirate
as well:

Me: “Belay that ye sea dog, I got me cutlass, where be ye jollyboat?”

Him: “Scupper that me hearties, this Sutler be dancin’ with Jack Ketch
YAAAAA-AAARRRRRGGG”

Someone else: “Shiver me timbers, use ye deadlights matey!”

Me: “Will ye sea dogs jes tell me where ta aim me broadsides?”

Random Guy: “YAAAARRRR me parrot and a ... plank! I mean ... Poop deck!”

Me: “WT-(yaar)-F?”

Suddenly a German tank rumbles over the horizon and hits me from behind,
demolishing my tank in a pillar of flame. Ten seconds later I’m standing
in the empty airfield with a guy named “Bl4ckb34rd” telling me “Yar, I
tried ta warn ye, matey.”

I hate you all.
