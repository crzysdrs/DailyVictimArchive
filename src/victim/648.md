No man, you're just as much to blame as I am. Last December when I
[concocted that fool-proof 32-step plan to get my hot girlfriend into
Cosplay](@/victim/527.md), you helped me out with steps 18-21 as well
as 27, 29, and 30. You share the responsibility for this!

I thought Cosplay would rock, you know, adults who dress up as anime
characters. Especially hot chicks. Dressing up as hot chick anime
characters, like Kasumi from *Dead or Alive 3*. And for a while it was
great. She was the spitting image of Kasumi, costume, hair, and all. At
AnimeCon '03, the whole cast of Kingdom Hearts fell to their knees at
the mere sight of her. One kid got a nosebleed on the spot.

She was like a half-inch-of-fabric away from being R-rated. It was
jiggletastic. She won awards. I think it went to her head.

Since then she's let her hair grow down past her butt, and last month
she dyed it purple. All of her clothes have poofy sleeves. She carries a
fan around so that no matter where she's standing her hair blows in the
wind.

She wears little kitty ears to the movies, man.

It went too far for me last week when I came home and she greeted me
from the balcony wearing a poofy schoolgirl uniform. She yelled
"Konnichiwa!" and dropped a bicycle on my head. Then she showed me the
battle droid she's building and pelted me with cards.

I need help, man.

I've developed a 32-step plan to wean my hot girlfriend off of this
whole Anime thing. Now, as you can see from this Excel spreadsheet...
