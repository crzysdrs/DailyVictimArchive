  Hey, one last question. You guys don't have any smoke bombs in this game, do you?
  You know, the kind people would put onto my head when my character can't move? No?
  Good ... gooooood.

 Wow, look at that! What's that you're demoing here at the trade show?
*[True Fantasy Live
Online](https://web.archive.org/web/20030518000000/http://gamespy.com/e32003/preview/xbox/1002468/)*
for the Xbox? Yeah, yeah that looks awesome! I really gotta hand it to
you. That looks incredible.  
  
 But, speaking as the online editor for the prestigious
[GameNostril](@/victim/595.md) publication, I'd like to make a few
suggestions.  
  
 I once spent over three months [tied up on the floor of my
apartment](@/victim/486.md) with no communication to the outside
world except via my *SOCOM: Navy Seals* headset. What I want to know is,
what precautions have you taken in case, you know, someone is playing
your game and suddenly gets trapped under a bookcase? Or, they've just
woken up in a bathtub full of ice with their kidneys missing? How will
they call the local authorities?  
  
 I'm not saying you make it the "x" button or anything, but definitely
some sort menu option under the 'Start' button or something. No? What
about some sort of "HELP I'M HANDCUFFED TO A STAIRWAY" macro? You know,
something players could enter into the game using just their nose or
teeth.  
  
 Have you given serious consideration to how people would play your game
while ball-gagged?  
  
 Okay, okay, fine. I understand. But you guys are just ASKING for a bad
review. Or maybe some kind of lawsuit. Oh, these? These are just ropes.
You know. For old time's sake. What's this? COPS? Get your hands off of
me! Hey, where were you guys when I needed you, hunh!?
