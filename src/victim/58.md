Hello there, gaming community! As a big name, big wig, and just plain
*big* game publisher, I love to talk to our fans -- you know, interface
with them on a one to one level. To Kibbitz, if you will. Chat. Talk.
Shoot the breeze. Beat them pulpy. Chew the fat. You know.

Did you hear about the new game we're publishing? Did you get the
complimentary copy I chucked through your window attached to a brick?
Sega Electronic GameReview gave it a 4.5 out of five stars. I've killed
for less!

That's right, you have my *personal* guarantee. Either this new game
totally kicks ass, or I will totally kick yours!

HolidayGameShopper.com gave this game a 94 out of 100. It deserved at
least a 98 -- They're still finding their ex-editor's missing fingers
scattered randomly about the office.

So go ahead, try it for yourself! If it isn't the most fantastic game
you've ever bought, I'll personally come to your house and pound you
until you spew juices like a lawn sprinkler. When they try to identify
the body, they're not going to know which orifice was supposed to have
contained your teeth.
