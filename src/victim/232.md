Be still, fool! To date this messageboard has been a forum of quiet
discussion about space simulation games. But you come in here, and
brazenly shout the name of \[whispers\] "*Derek Smart, PhD,*" MENSA
member and designer of the
*[BattleCruiser](http://web.archive.org/web/20010627000000/http://www.fileplanet.com/index.asp?section=445&file=61798)*
series. Don't you understand that by speaking his name aloud you summon
him? Then he's going to start posting long essays about his game, which
will in turn attract people who like to get on his case and relentlessly
mock his refusal to support asanine and obscure computer upgrades like
"Windows ME?" Then we'll have a circus on our hands.

His name should only be spoken reverently, and in italicized font. Lower
your voice with regard to his superior stature. Say his name, and the
name of his masterwork, with hushed humility. *Derek Smart* is a lone
wolf, a maverick, the most intelligent coder ever to grace gaming with
the smooth caressing touch of his soft loving fingers. *Derek Smart*
makes graphics cards faster. *Derek Smart* makes colorful clothes
withstand multiple washings. *Derek Smart* has already discovered and
harnessed the secrets of fusion power with only harmless delicious pure
water as a waste byproduct, but as we all know he got screwed by his
publisher.

But please, do not speak his name with anything but reverence, or he
will arrive in this forum to set the record straight. \[Peers warily
over shoulder.\] Shhhh...hhh...hhh...
