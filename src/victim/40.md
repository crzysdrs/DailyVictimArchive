I know, I know. But try to see it my way. When we met and started
dating, that was before I discovered this server where they're playing
Elite Force CTF on map CTF\_VOY1 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

Things are different now. This map plays continuously, and the server is
packed. Two days ago I took a break to get a sandwich, and it was hours
before I managed to get back in. HOURS! Think of all the captures I
missed out on. So I can't leave.

Instead of going out tonight, I was hoping you could call that Chinese
place, and we could order in. Then you can shovel the food into my mouth
between rounds.

I know you need me, sweetie. But these guys need me too. Look at this
dude guarding the flag room here with me -- He can hardly shoot. It
looks like he's using the keyboard to play instead of the mouse. *And he
calls himself a Klingon!!*

Oh, you're leaving? Hey, while you're up, could you empty my pee bottle?
