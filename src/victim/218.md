No no, my arm isn't broken or anything, I just ... Yeah, I won't be able
to play. Actually, I can play, but I won't be able to move around 'cuz I
can't use both mouse and keyboard simultaneously at the moment. I'll
just have to stand there and use mouselook, like a human turret. Maybe
you guys could push me into battle?

Aw c'mon, don't make me go into details. I don't really want to talk
about it. No no, no details. C'mon, cut me some slack. Well, okay, you
know how sometimes you wake up in an unfamiliar hotel room wearing
clothes that aren't yours with a leopard-print bra wrapped around your
head? Right, and you have to dismantle the headboard 'cuz you're
handcuffed to it? Pretty soon after you make it out the window you find
yourself running home through a cornfield ducking low because you're not
sure those police choppers overhead are looking for you or for the guys
chasing you screaming in Italian? Cool, yah, you know what I'm talking
about. Crazy weekend.

Crap, there's a knock at my door. I'll catch you guys later, I'm gonna
hide in my stove.
