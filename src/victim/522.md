I find it particularly troubling that the cover of the CD is a photocopy
of a handwritten label. Like I said, it’s completely blank, but the
developer released a “patch” the same day it hit shelves.

I downloaded all 450MB of the patch and unzipped it into a folder, then
clicked on the only available icon: “non\_playable\_alpha.exe.” First it
asked me for my CD key. Then, it launched the auto-updater.

I suspected that they may have shipped the product a little early.

So I called up the publisher and chatted with their customer support
line. They sent over two big burly men who gave me a swirly.

I can’t say I’m too pleased with my purchase, but according to the
message boards the upcoming 0.04 patch will offer *menus*. I can’t wait!
