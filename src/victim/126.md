Fool! As you and I both know, tapping forward+kick slams down the boot
of righteousness. But until now only I have been able to gain complete
mastery of the FOOT OF FURY. Hear me now as we begin round 1 -- FIGHT! I
slide forward with a double tap! Will I sweep the legs? Oh no friend, I
don't fight low. I merely stand upright, raise my leg, and BEND YOU with
the FOOT flying down from above! It is the Foot of Fury! With leg high I
mark my territory as a puppy in the woods!

My Foot of Fury cannot be descirbed in a short phrase unless that phrase
contains the word "devastating" and is pronounced while wincing.

But now, as we begin round two, you and I charge toward one another in
what would apparently be a repeat of your same ignominious defeat. But,
as I tap forward and prepare to press kick, what is that I see? A boot?
On my head? A foot? A FOOT!? Hurling me to the arena floor like sack of
turnips!?

That was *MY* foot!

That was *MY* fury!

You pantomiming bitch! You may have mastered my technique, but you will
never possess ... **MY SOUL!!**
