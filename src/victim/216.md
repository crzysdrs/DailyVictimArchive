Every evening around 5:15 it's the same thing. I hear the squeaking of
tight leather boots stalking down the carpet, and then he pops his head
over my cubicle wall. Sometimes he snaps a riding crop.

"VE PLAY MIT ZE CLOSEN COMBAT SIE JA!?" he barks.

Keep in mind the dude's from Columbus, Ohio. I think he learned every
word of German he knows from either Hogan's Heroes or the Guns of
Navarone. "Hang on," I say, "Lemme finish this email."

"NEIN! DU NICHT MIT DER EMAIL UND MACHT DU MIT DER WOLFENSTEIN UND DAS
VORLD VAR ZWEI ONLINE!"

"Yeah, Jim, I follow, I just need to -"

"LEIBE MEINE ABSCHMENKE!!" he cries, randomly breaking stuff on my desk
before he storms off. You can't really argue with that.

Sometimes I worry, you know? A good red-blooded capitalist American —
one quarter Jewish even — who insists on playing as the Germans in
World War II games. It's not even ideological. "They have cooler
uniforms," he confided to me one lunch hour. Another time he explained
that players who played as the Germans tended to be more organized and
serious about co-op games. "They don't all try to be heroes," he
explained. One time, he says, he logged onto a server and nobody had
joined the allies yet, so he and his fellow Germans began marching in
formations. "Everyone ... all my little men ... they like to march in
neat little lines!" he said, talking softly and fiddling with the straw
in his milk carton. Suddenly he leapt to his feet and pounded both fists
on the lunchtable, spilling my coke. "JIM UBER ALLES!!!" He cried, face
red with exertion.

I worry a little. About Jim.
