I’m sick and tired of my *Warcraft III* skillz getting ground into the
dirt by random Internet strangers. Playing a game is like bending over
for the prison soap. But not in 2003!

I resolve that my Undead shall reign triumphant!

I resolve that my Ghouls will pour forth like lube at a porno shoot,
crunching your sorry little trees underfoot like peanut shells on the
floor of a Texas barbecue.

I resolve that my Meat Wagons will usher forth a new era of horror, a
flesh-flaying feast of maggots whipping through the air like hail in a
trailer park.

I resolve that those few who survive the charge of my Death Knight will
shrivel like raisins in the sun under the crushing follow-up blow from
my Abominations, their mangled corpses driven into the ground like tent
pegs, depriving the soil of fertility for generations to come.

I resolve that my Dread Lord will kick your stupid tree’s ass. If your
tree does not in fact possess an ass -- and I suspect as much -- he will
first create one. Then he will lodge a boot in it. I resolve to LAUGH,
aloud, no matter how often this spectacle is repeated.

I also resolved to quit smoking. This probably explains all my pent-up
rage.

I should also stop pushing children off of bicycles, but A MAN CAN’T
CHANGE OVERNIGHT.
