Timmy, Jody, come here and look at this. This? This is Mr. Happy Snake.
He's got two big fangs and he comes from Daddy's computer. Daddy needs
Mr. Happy Snake's help in order to play *EverQuest* three hours each
night, and as we all know, if Daddy doesn't get his EQ he's less likely
to be generous with ice cream.

Mr. Happy snake lives in this cave in the wall. The cave is a bad, bad
place, so don't ever stick your tongue in there unless either of you
were considering playing "tow truck" again with Daddy's cable modem.

Look, see, I'm putting Mr. Happy Snake back in his cave, and see all the
lights turn on on Mr. Computer? That's great. Mr. Computer needs to stay
lit up so that he can scare away the monsters that will emerge from your
closet to flay the living flesh off of your bodies the moment the sun
sets. Okay now, go play!
