Okay, here's the new deal: One of you run forward, I'll punch the
goalie. Whoever has the ball should shoot. Okay, get ready. I'm going to
punch the goalie now. Are you ready? KAPOW!

Dude you didn't SHOOT. You have to shoot the ball. The "A" button, not
the "B" button. Hang on, as soon as we get the ball again, I'll punch
the goalie. Ready? WHAMS! I decked him! What are you doing? You passed
the ball to Bill again. The whole point of [Sega Soccer
Slam](https://web.archive.org/web/20020528000000/http://www.planetnintendo.com/features/gcn/reviews/soccerslam/)
is not to pass the ball like a bunch of namby-pamby short-bus pissant
mammaboy limp-wangs, the object is to strut around in masks and tights
and wreck some chumps.

So here, I've got the ball, I'm gonna chuck it your way and then I'm
gonna hit the goalie. You ready? Here. BAMS! You like that? What the
hell, you didn't take the shot. Let's stop trying to play as a team
here, guys. This is a goalie-punching game, got-dammit, I'm not walking
off this field 'til we have some points on the board and some cleats in
some guy's face. Run forward, I'll punch the goalie. Okay, fine. I'll
punch YOU.
