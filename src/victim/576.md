I don’t think we can really hope to have a fair and balanced
conversation if you keep batting around terms like “Vaporware.”
“Vaporware” is a very serious word. I prefer to use the term “Ongoing
Project.”

I’ll admit that development has hit some hurdles in the past. We were
somewhat delayed when we went from using the Quake 1 engine to the Quake
2 engine to power the game’s graphics. And then to the Unreal engine.
Then to the LithTech engine. And back to the Quake engine. And then for
a couple of weeks it was a side-scroller. And that one time last year
after a night of binge drinking the UPS guy woke us up and when we came
around we saw that we were using the Tribes engine. For a really
creative development house, this is all part of the normal design
process.

But I assure you that the game is progressing nicely and we’re on pace
for a release date we have not yet announced. Did you see those
screenshots we posted? Two years ago? Pretty exciting stuff, hunh! Now,
those weren’t the *in-game* models. Or maps. But, aside from that and
the lighting, that’s what you’re gonna see in the final product.

Some would argue that a five-year or more development cycle is
excessive. I beg to differ. Good games, real good ones, age like a fine
wine. It’s a process I like to call “Game Fermentation.” But when this
baby comes out -- HO BOY -- you’re gonna be BLOWN AWAY. Just look at
those screenshots! The ones we posted two years ago! And we weren’t even
*halfway* done with the game, back then.
