  I believe the base may have a secret entrance through the sewers. I'll try that.
  It's fitting that I should be reduced to slughing through poop.

There are some blows you just can't expect anyone to recover from. Like
being tortured in Nam, losing a wife and kid in childbirth .... or that
one Half-Life "upgrade" that wrecked the TeamFortress super-conc jump.
My life went steadily downhill from there.

Back in the day? I was on top. I mean that literally -- me and the
skybox would lock lips in loving embrace whenever I wanted. I had the
timing down perfect -- I could super concussion jump at will. No wall
was high enough to stop me. No sniper perch was safe. I was sailing like
Earth Wind and Fire. I would look down and see the rolling terrain far
below me, the little bridges, tiny pipebombs, and helpless miniscule
enemy medics rushing impotently about the shrinking explosion of my
spent concussion grenade ... I was God above.

One day it all came crashing onto my head, just as I used to crash onto
the heads of unsuspecting snipers. They took away my super conc-jump.
Soon I could never get the flag. Many times I couldn't find the front
door of a base, having never used it before.

Shortly thereafter I lost my girlfriend. "I ... I can't get up," I tried
to tell her. It's funny how you take things for granted.

Now I'm as landlocked as Switzerland. The enemy base seems so tall from
down here. I am a prisoner of gravity. I am a worm. I am dirt.
