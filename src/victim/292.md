Lemme get this straight -- I move the mouse DOWN, and I'll start to look
UP? What is this, Flight Simulator? This is *QUAKE* for the love of
moms.

I want to kill people with pinpoint accuracy. That means that every
miniscule motion must be transplated from cerebral cortex to finger
muscles to mouse to USB port to processor to crosshairs. Now, imagine if
I had to apply my spatial nervous system into cross-referencing an
inverted Y axis. We're adding cycles upon cycles. Furthermore, it's just
whack.

While you're at it, why not switch your arrow keys for word processing,
or rig your car to drive at full speed when your foot isn't on the gas
pedal?
