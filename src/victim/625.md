  Actually, I could get used to this. It's like I float around the room. OoooOOOoooo...
  I'm like that half-a-dude from Jedi Knight: Dark Forces 2.

Wha -- WAAAUUGGH! My legs! I can't feel my legs!

...I can't SEE my legs. My legs are gone! So are my shoes! I've got no
shoes, or feet to put them on! How am I even standing upright? What
happened?

Where's the artist? I was supposed to come onto the victim today to
argue with [that dude who loves KOTOR but never played
it.](@/victim/624.md) Instead, I'M A FLOATING FREAK OF PHYSICAL
NATURE!

HotSoup's computer must've crashed before he finished drawing me or
scanning me in. Where is he? How can he possibly send his victim
pictures to Fargo? For God's sakes! Somebody give this man a Kinko's
gift certificate before my legless torso flops plummets uncerimoniously
to the floor.

Soup? SOOOUUPP!!

\[Today's victim inspired by Victim artist HotSoup's catastrophic
computer loss. Send him some good karma!\]
