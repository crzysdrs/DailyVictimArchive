It was a terrible mistake to teach her to play [Black and
White](http://web.archive.org/web/20010423000000/http://www.planetblackandwhite.com/),
I can see that now. See, one of the cool things about the game is that
you can set it to name all the little villagers after your friends and
co-workers. On the surface, this sounded like a good time.

The reality is that it gives me an uncomfortable glimpse into my
girlfriend's psyche.

For example, this weekend I inadvertantly left the garage door open all
afternoon. She wasn't happy when I got home but didn't say much.
However, on the computer I noticed that she had painstakingly taken over
an hour to carefully arrange an enormous, uh, pile of -- well -- dung.
Sort of a, shall we say, pooramid. Massive. A 30-story crap. Dwarfing
even the largest of structures, the villagers toiled day in and day out
in the shadow of this giant mound of ... well, you get the picture.

And as I contemplated this massive pile of the bad stuff, I saw -- so
tiny in comparison -- a little tiny villager crawling his way out from
under the mass. Any guess as to what his name was?

Yeah, it was me.

She put me in a pile of poop, Jim. Things can't be going well when, you
know, you wake up *there*.
