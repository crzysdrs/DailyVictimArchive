  You call that a tip? Fine, your excommunicated. Further more, I now pronounce you
  and this orc man and wife. Killing her for XP would damage your immortal soul!

After [getting ordained by some Internet
guys](https://web.archive.org/web/20020716000000/http://www.gamespy.com/fargo/february02/minister/)
I've started to turn over a new leaf. Previously, my online experience
has been pretty self-centered. I'd kill things, I'd grab lewt, I'd camp
monsters ... me, me, me. But I'm getting up there in the years. I
realized that if I wanted to really make a meaningful contribution to
the Internet gaming scene, I needed to get started.

So I've taken up marrying people online. You know. CREATING, not
destroying. ENRICHING, not poaching. MATRIMONYING, not camping. It's not
a thankless job, but it's a lot of hard work. Real-life ministers rarely
have to worry about trying to marry a lesbian couple only to discover
moments before the ceremony that both women are in fact horny young
boys. Well. Unless it's a minister from Vegas.

One thing I like for people to keep in mind is that vows for an online
wedding should be appropriate for the venue. That is to say, "In
sickness and in health" really doesn't make sense since most people
spend more time online when they're sick anyways. I prefer "In smooth
times and lag." Also, death sure does do people part often in an online
game — sometimes several times a day. So instead, I like to wrap up the
vows with "Until I'm sick of paying ten bucks a month for this laggy
unbalanced camp-fest, but in the meantime I'll help you recover your
corpse even if I'm supposed to be into work tomorrow morning."

I was nervous for my first online wedding, then eventually I settled in
and had it down to a well-rehearsed routine. I'd help the bride and
groom get all their guests together to have a fun party afterwards.
Pretty soon I was kinda casual about the whole thing. I'd get liquored
up and just broadcast to the whole server, "Who wannntz to get
Hitchz0red?" I'd marry people on the spot. Sometimes I'd marry
threesomes and give them the key to a big room in the inn. I'd marry
passers-by.

I married one guy to his horse.

This marrying stuff is pretty cool. My church — so far as I can tell
from the email they sent me when I filled out the form on their webpage
— has nothing against polygamy, so right now I'm busy marrying a
continuous chain of 74 young men and women. In fact, here's a pretty
little lady right now. Just hold your hands to the screen and say, "I
do." I pronounce you man and wife, or woman and wife depending on what
you got in your pants. Doesn't matter to me. You two head into a private
chat and go consummate somethun', okay? Don't forget: I take tips!
