Ladies and gentlemen, submitted for your approval, a man -- pictured
here -- preparing to relax after work in a warm, refreshing shower. Two
stories below, [his son lurks in the basement](@/victim/92.md),
hopelessly addicted to EverQuest. Our man in the shower secretly
suspects that his son runs an Internet pornography ring due to his long
hours at the PC, but such thoughts are far from his mind as the warm,
refreshing water relaxes his body. He is in bliss.

His son, meanwhile, is tense. On edge. jittering with fear. He is deep
in the Mines of Nurga looking for an elusive Burynai Legion Gi for his
Cleric, but he has been separated from his guild and danger lurks in
every shadow. Morever, he has to pee. Really, really bad.

But he cannot turn away from his PC, lest the monsters engulf him. He
must find a safe corner. His legs are crossed; he bounces up and down in
agony.

Meanwhile, above him, his father begins to sing from the opera Il
Trovatore. His voice is shrill, but not loud enough for anyone to hear.
He is at peace. Little does he know that he is hurtling helplessly and
uncontrollably toward an egregious destiny.

During the creshendo of the shower-opera, his son discovers a safe
corner. Quickly he whips out of his chair and darts into the basement
bathroom. He takes care of his business. He can hear via the pipes that
someone is in the shower, but he is too distracted to take note. Without
heed, he flushes the toilet.

Two stories above and moments later, PAIN pours from the showerhead. His
father is suddenly the recipient of gallons of scalding water. His opera
dramatically ends; he HOWLS out in agony.

His son hears the cries and believes them to be coming from his Cleric.
There is no time to finish zipping up his pants; he bounds out of the
bathroom and begins hopping frantically toward his computer as his
trowsers fall down below his knees.

The stairway creeks and clatters as his father, soaking wet, wearing
little but for a towel and shower cap, bounds angrily down into the
basement to scold his unintentionally malicious offspring. Before he can
even register his complaint, he discovers his son playing EverQuest with
his pants around his ankles.

He points a soapy brush accusingly.

"I KNEW IT!" he says.
