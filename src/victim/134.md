It was all fine until a couple of weeks ago, when he got *Phantasy Star
Online*. So, first, that blows 'cuz I can't play Sonic anymore. Dad's
hoggin that Dreamcast 24/7. But mostly it stinks 'cuz he's totally
hooked. I mean, beyond hope.

He told me to stop calling him "Dad" and to just refer to him as Nordlax
the New Human Hunter of Oberon Block 12. I wanted to play ball with him
today in the back yard but he said he had planned to hunt monogrinders
all morning. Then that afternoon it was all about him and his buddies in
the mine lookin' for ph4t l3wt.

Last night at dinner, I went for a second helping of potatoes, and he
slapped my hand with a spoon and yelled, "That's for the MAG!"

He just loves that stupid Dragonslayer +9 sword. "Why can't YOU do 170
points damage in a single swing?" he asked me. You know he named his
sword "William Junior?" I tried to tell him, "But Dad! *My* name is Bill
Jr.!" and he said:

"What? As if I would name you after the *sword!*"

Yeah. Harsh. I know it.
