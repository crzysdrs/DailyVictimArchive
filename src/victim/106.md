Hi kids! I'm the Gaming Gigabuys Software Giga-Bear! Welcome to our
giga-grand opening. Looking for the latest and greatest of great big
gobs of giga-gaming fun? C'mon down to Metro Pointe Mall! Be sure to
bring a gun to put an end to my miserable giga-got-damned existence.

Well, hello Tommy. Looking for a Digimon cheat guide? I'm sorry, we're
all sold out. Ha no, that's a lie, I tossed them in the dumpster. You
know why, you little punk? 'cuz pissants like you whine and beg until
daddy buys you a $50 game, then you whine and beg to get the $12
strategy guide, so that you can beat the $50 game in an afternoon, and
then you don't want to play anymore, and you wasted all of my got-damned
time, and all of my got-damned money, so then I gotta take a job at
retail in a fuzzy bear suit to make the alimony payments. Go home!
Little shit.

Hello hello! We've got Giga-Great deals here at Gaming Giga-buys!
Counter-Strike is %20 off. Of course, if you buy Half-Life and download
CS for free, you get twice the game for half the money. You know who
gets the shaft when you do that, kids? *I DO*, the gaming gagabear, why
not just bend me over this discount software bin and sodomize me? Any
takers?

I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. Come here, did I mention we've
got *Barbie Fashion Designer*? Did I mention that I was a classically
trained actor? I played Horatio in the 1986 Pittsburgh Playhouse
production of Hamlet. Now what do I do? I hock copies of *Who Wants to
be a Millionaire*. Fifteen years ago the Prince of Denmark was telling
me about how well he knew Yorick. Now I got Benny from the Whattapretzel
stand across the way telling me how he just evolved his fucking
Jigglypuff. SOMEONE PLEASE PUT A BULLET IN MY GIGA-HEAD! Thank you.
