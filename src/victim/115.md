I'm serious, I wasn't at the keys, dude. It was Sarah, my baby girl. No,
not my girlfriend, my baby girl -- she's like eight months old dude.
There was definitely a substantial victory. I'm not going to go so far
as to say 0wnage, but, I'm just saying, it wasn't close.

No no, I wasn't helping. She's just -- you know, she gets on the mouse
and it's just ugly.

Dude c'mon. I saw the score. Plus, she was giggling -- I mean, she knew
she *had* you, man. I'm serious. At one point, she was pooping.

Okay, okay, I'll give you that it wasn't 0wnage. But, you have to admit,
there was a serious smackdown. Definitely a smackdown of decisive
porportions.
