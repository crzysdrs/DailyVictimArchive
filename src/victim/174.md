So then, where to begin? I believe your thesis statement, "Th4 Un10n
l4y3d d0wn s0m3 s3r10us 0wn4g3," is perfectly accurate but unsupported
by much of the rest of the paper. Not to mention your gratuitious
helping of grammatical problem spots. For example, LOOK at that
sentence! Have I taught you nothing? The Union "*l41d*" down, not
"*l4y3d*" down. And -- regional dialects aside -- in my class we lay
down serious *0wn1j,* with an 1j, thank you very much.

Now then. On to Part II, the section entitled "Un10n b3 bus71n' 0u7 7ha
m4d pl4nz y0." In sentence three you inform the reader that "7ha Un10n
b3 411 h4rdc0r3 4n' br1ng1n' 0n s0m3 s3r10us hur7 w17h 7h4 '4n4c0nd4
pl4n', w3rd." You misplaced the comma.

Later in the same section, you describe the Union blockade of
Confederate ports by simply stating that the Union was "c4mp1ng." Class,
how many times have we discussed this? You cannot simply accuse the
Union of camping, you have to back that up with SUPPORTED FACTS. How
were they camping? In what ways were they total whores? How did this
make them wusses? Specifics, Henderson! Specifics!

Right. On to Part III, "Gr4n7 G03s 707411y P0s741." Excellent use of the
word "b17chs14p" in the opening paragraph, by the way. But listen here
as I read aloud: "Gr4n7 un104d3d s0m3 m4d sk111z 4nd sh0w3d G3n3r41 133
h1s p1mp h4nd 4nd w3n7 411 7h3 w4y to R1chm0nd."

That is a run-on sentence.

I'll spare you my commentary on Part V, "Sh3rm4n sm4Qs G30rg14." D
minus, Henderson!
