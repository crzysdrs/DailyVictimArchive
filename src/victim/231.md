  My, that was an unenlightened run. You didn't even take second. The worldspirit
  looks upon you with the sadness of a disappointed father. Hand me the controller
  so that I may purfiy it with skiilz.

I have meditated long, my pupil, and as the wind sometimes sighs its
sweet song through the mountains so, too, I shall finally speak.

The secret to success in *4x4 EVO* for the Dreamcast or Playstation 2 is
not simply to trick out one's Nissan, but to enter a state of mind
favorable to passage between the sands of travel. I speak of becomming
one with the road.

The road and yourself have much in common. You are both dirty and
covered with bumps. You're wide. Many men, they tread on you. Your life
is a pathway, not a destination. Animals are flattened and killed on
you. You smell like asphalt. In the winter you crack.

One with the road. You must be one with the road! Or, you should know
the cheat codes. Now, please lapse into silent meditation, my KFC order
just got here. I shall lick the greased fingers of enlightenment.
