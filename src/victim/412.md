No man, leave it alone! It didn't ask for this kind of treatment! It's
an American GameCube. It's all American. It's a patriot. It was meant to
play American games. It's the barbecue rib-eating pro-football watchin'
light-beer drinkin' U.S. of M.F'in.A. allegiance-pledgin' all-American
GameCube! It doesn't want to play Japanese versions of games. That's why
they're Japanese and it's ... American!

How would you like it if someone opened you up -- using special tools --
and then put a switch on your butt that would make you suddenly speak
nothing but Japanese? Would you like that? Hunh? Would you?

Hang on, actually, that switch-on-the-butt thing would be pretty cool.
You could sit down to watch anime and then "click" suddenly you'd
understand what everyone was saying. Er, wait, it would have problems,
though. Like, what if you were making out with some chick, and then she
started getting hot and heavy, but she bumped the switch and you were
like "Domo Arigato Molaka eye waddy-wah obidiah oh, eh? KANEDA!" and she
would freak out and throw water on you. Yeah, yeah, THAT's what I'm
saying. You want to put our GameCube through THAT?

Oh -- put the soldering iron down -- oh man, if hardware could scream,
I'd have to cover my ears, too.
