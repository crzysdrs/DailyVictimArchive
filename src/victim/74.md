  I am a medical professional. I'm just saying, I know how much pain a human body
  can sustain while still remaining conscious. Now, what was that you were going to
  tell me about Minsc again? Oh it wasn't that important? Good.

Okay hon, I love you, but let's take it easy with the cursed berserking
sword stories, okay? They just don't go over well with the people at the
hospital.

Oh no, [I'm not trying to say your stories about playing Baldur's Gate
II aren't exciting](@/victim/61.md). I mean, look, whenever I can
stay awake I enjoy them. What I'm saying is, frankly, if you bring up
that Cursed Berserking Sword -- I'm sorry, it was a *+3* berserking
sword, I understand that lemme finish -- if you bring it up at the
party? I will suplex you into the mini bar.

Please try to see it my way honey, these people have just worked
overtime holiday shifts. Just yesterday, for instance, we had to treat a
guy who came in after [some woman at an ISP attacked him with a desk
fan](@/victim/46.md). Or this evening, when someone claimed to have
[sustained a brutal Madden 2001 injury](@/victim/68.md)? Do you think
they want to hear about your new broadsword (sorry, +3 two-handed cursed
berserking sword I know I know)?

So, we'll make a deal. I promise not to bring up the fact that you were
laid off from your part-time job at foto hut, provided you promise me --
pinky swear -- that you won't talk about your sword. Or the staff. Or
the armor of the undead. Or your new halfling character.

Alternatively, I will chuck your ass through a plate glass window.
