  them into the 7-11, hah hah!

I'd like to take a few moments to address the readers of this fine
gaming site. I hope I'll be able to make my point clearly, as I'm
currently wearing sharpened prosthetic teeth and speaking is, at the
moment, both difficult and excruciating.

Too often those of us who consider ourselves freaks are portrayed as
such in the media. Stereotyping and profiling run rampant! Those of us
who like to explore visceral terror and the dark sides of both the human
conscious and collective unconscious are often portrayed on television
and in the news as "dark" and "moody" people. So I like to dress as a
vampire and go to conventions. Big deal! I don't actually suck blood.
Well, not "suck," per se.

Anyways, listen up, mass media! We're tired of being an obscure
subculture and we're stepping out! I say, freaks unite! Howl at the moon
and rise yourselves up into the realms of mainstream sub-cultures like
skateboarders, hackers, or punks. Subcultures like those are
consistently cast in a favorable light.

I would continue, however, my gums have started to bleed. It's not so
much the pain, it's that I want to hurry up and show my friends. Thank
you for your time.
