  drugs!

Look at me! I'm 21 now! I'm a college student who does important college
things, not all of which involve being held upside down over a keg. And
for these things I need an Alienware PC! One of those big ones, in a
case that looks like a soda machine and sounds like a hairdryer! I need
one of those big muthas with 64 USB ports and a graphics card that has
to have its own power cord!

I think I'm being reasonable. It's not like I asked for drugs. Or guns.
Not like my 12th birthday. I'm more mature now, more settled into my
life, older, wiser ... able to buy my own cigarettes ... and I need that
PC!

C'mon. You and mom split up. Now you're both seeing other women. With so
many parents, you think ONE of you would kick down with the PC! A big
one, with a custom case that looks like the neon-drenched concession
stand of a movie theater. Complete with a popcorn popper.

I don't think that's unreasonable. It's not like I'm asking for an
automatic pistol or my own crystal meth lab. It's not like I'm asking
for prostitutes -- not like my 18th birthday. I just want a PC that
disrupts the ionosphere whenever I turn it on. IS THAT SO UNREASONABLE?
