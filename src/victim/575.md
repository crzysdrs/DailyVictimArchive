Hello kind shopkeeper! Might I inquire as to the proprietary status of
the jars outside of your entryway? They were yours? Oh, in that case I
do humbly apologize. I inadvertently picked them up and threw them
against the side of your house. All of them, one at a time. Mistakes do
happen!

Now then, let’s talk business. So, what is it that you sell? I see, you
sell potions. Red potions and blue potions, eh? Hold on one second, I
hate to interrupt. Is that a vase you have in the corner of the room?
Next to the stool? Hold on a second, I’d like to take a closer look. OH
NO! Did I smash it? I really just wanted to turn it around to look for a
maker’s mark, but somehow I inadvertently pulled out my sword and jumped
at it, swinging frantically, my little legs whirling to rush after the
gem that popped out to stuff it greedily into my booty bag. I don’t know
how that happened. Oops, I seem to have smashed your stool as well.

My bad!

Now, we were talking about potions weren’t we? Yes yes, do go on. Red
potions ... and blue potions. Fascinating. Perhaps I could hear you
better if I jumped behind the counter here? Yes, go on, go on. Potions
you say. WHOA! You’ve got a whole back room back here. Can I take a
look? You stay right there.

HOLY CRAP! (Pardon my language). What you have back here is AN ENTIRE
ROOM FULL OF POTTERY! You have no idea what a collection like this is
worth. Might I take a look at -- oh no, don’t bother to get up. I just
wanted to pick up this vase and examine its fine worksmanshi--SMASH! Oh
man, it just slipped out of my hands and hit the opposite wall really
really hard, I don’t know how that happened. Hey, you wouldn’t mind if I
practiced my spinning sword attack in here, would you? I’ll be extra
careful. Oops! Oh, oops! And -- Oops! Here, let me put this one back on
the shelf -- oops!
