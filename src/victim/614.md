Keep it low, you never know who's listening in at the lunch room. Yeah,
I'm sick of working in the back of this stuffy bank calculating
homeowner lending rates. I applied for a job at a game developer, but I
didn't want my manager to see, so I wrote my cover letter and resume in
l33tspeak.

These stuffed shirts at the bank can't read words made out of numbers
for their life. They think "teh" is a typo and that "0wning" something
means you've paid off the mortgage. They think a n00b is a type of candy
bar filling. I could probably leave my resume sitting out on the printer
and they'd think it was a spreadsheet.

The only tough part was giving them my phone number in l33t. I mean, do
I type it out as 949-555-7413? Or, is it 9A9-SSS-TAlE?
