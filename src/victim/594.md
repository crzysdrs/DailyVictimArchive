  Okay, time to get up. Hm? No way. Up!


  Well, I'll be damned. You really *are* stuck to that beanbag.

Now look at you. What -- what is that? On the plate next to you? Are
those the remains of some Ramen noodles? Oh man, did you even microwave
those or did you just ... *soak* them? Nevermind, nevermind, I don’t
want to know.

Last week when I gave you that old copy of *Harvest Moon*, I just wanted
to introduce you to a classic. I mean, you can’t really claim to be a
gamer unless you’ve played through some of the old greats. But this?
This right here? Is SAD. That shirt you’re wearing used to be blue,
didn’t it? I can’t tell, what with the stains and all.

I come down the stairs, and for the fifth day in a row the sun is
dawning and you’re crumpled up into my beanbag fingering an empty bag of
Doritos and mumbling about how it’s time to put the cows in the barn.

Those cows aren’t real, Jason. They’re fake, computer cows.

Now you’re baking a cake. You know, your character in the game eats
better than you do. Oh, I see! The cake isn’t for you. It’s for the girl
you want to make your wife. I gotcha, I gotcha.

You know, you have a *real* wife. Yes, yes you do. And she hasn’t seen
you in a week. I’m just, you know, bringing this kind of stuff to your
attention. That’s all.
