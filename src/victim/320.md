I was excited about the *Jedi Starfighter* game for the PS2 because
Samuel L. Jackson is on the cover. And, as we all know, the "L" in
Samuel L. Jackson stands for "I will whoop your ass." So anyways, I get
home, I rip open the wrapping, the big sticker, the little sticker, and
finally get into the game. I will now quote to you directly from the
manual:

<span style="color: #008800;">*"As the political tension between the
Republic and the secessionist movement led by Count Dooku intensifies,
Dooku makes a secret deal with Captain Cavik Toth, a young ambitious
ally of the Trade Federation who hopes to take control of the
resource-rich Karthakk system."*</span>

What? Tension between who? With the what? And the Count? Of the who?
Making the deal with the hunh? Allied with the What? What the HELL is
going on here!? Just tell me who the frickin' bad guys are! Compare it
to the beginning of the original *Star Wars* movie:

<span style="color: #008800;">*"It is a period of civil war. Rebel
spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory
against the evil Galactic Empire. During the battle, Rebel spies managed
to steal secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star,
an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire
planet."*</span>

Ho yeah! Now see, I *GET* that. The rebels are good, because it says
right there: the Empire is *Evil!* And the Death Star can destroy an
entire planet. What more do you need to know? NOTHING! YOU KNEW EXACTLY
WHICH ACTION FIGURES TO BUY! YOU WERE DUMB! AND HAPPY!

But now I'm trying to fly my spaceship and I got Dookie and Windu and
Freedo and Master Gollum and the alien pirate Nym and Chunky and Sauce
and the rest of the Whassup gang all barking orders at me that I have to
save Planet K-mart from Cleveland. What the hell is going on!? I AM SO
CONFUSED! Just point me at some evil robots or something!

Man, if I wanted learn stupid political stuff about aliens, I woulda
been a Star Trek fan instead.
