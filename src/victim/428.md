  a wall hanging upside down above a three-story drop calling for help, but couldn't
  be heard above the din of the music and the games and the strippers.\]

Attention attention! Listen up, people. Because our entire upper-level
administrative staff is at an off-site meeting today, according to the
spaghetti-like organizational chart, I'm in charge of things for the
duration. I'm glad to see you're all here on time. Thank you. Now, let's
all move forward with my special plan that I've drawn up for just such
an occasion.

Stevenson, Talmudge, you guys start spinning the tunes. Ray, Hartman,
Milkovich, I need you guys to take down every non-essential company
server and replace 'em with *Unreal Tournament* and *Day of Defeat*
servers. Rowlings, you're in charge of taking orders and using the petty
cash fund to buy us all copies of *WarCraft III.* Richards? Call in the
strippers -- remember, we need both male and female strippers because I
don't want to be responsible for any sexual harassment lawsuits.

What's that, Hartman? What do you call this? This is an email server,
Hartman. I said to take down NON-ESSENTIAL servers. Do you REALLY think
any of us our going to be CHECKING OUR EMAIL when Randy's setting up a
bootleg movie server? I've a mind to fire you, but you mix a mean
margarita, so get to it.

If you'll excuse me, the gang from accounting has turned the side of the
rear stairway into a Velcro wall and as you can see by my getup, I GET
FIRST DIBS. Let's make this day count, people!
