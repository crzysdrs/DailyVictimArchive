I'm not saying it's against the rules or anything, but I mean, he's got
a really fast car and he's allowed to run red lights. There's NO reason
for him to sit still at an intersection waiting for people to run stop
signs. What a lamer!

Look, I'm not saying he shouldn't be doing it, I'm just saying he's got
no self-respect. He should be roaming around hunting, not just sitting
there. *TOTAL* loser. Look, if I was a state trooper? I'd be all over
those freeways like Judge Dredd. I'd be Mel Gibson in the Road Warrior,
Nicholas Cage in Gone in Sixty seconds. I'd be a streak. I wouldn't even
turn my lights off. I'd stop people, get them to pull over, then tell
them that I'll let them out of the ticket if they could beat me in a
drag race.

But I sure as hell wouldn't camp an intersection all day slurpin'
doughnuts and staring at a stop sign. What's next, Highway Patrol? Spawn
killing?
