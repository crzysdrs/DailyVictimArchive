  A small, weeping rubber ducky looked at me mournfully from the dry, gouged corner
  of the barren pool. I'll have to live with that image for the rest of my life.

Hey kids, yeah, could you put the *Tony Hawk Pro Skater* game down for a
second? Hello? Hello Papa talking, papa unhappy, 'kay?

I just went for a dip in the pool and found myself, instead, sliding
down a slick cement indentation in the gound that -- all but for a
couple stagnant puddles -- was completely and indisputably devoid of
water. When I left you guys alone on Friday for the weekend, our
swimming pool was just that -- a pool. Of water. Today it is a hole.
Filled with ... nothing.

On closer inspection I discovered a myriad of four-wheeled tracks
leading back and forth over the cement around the puddles. The edge of
the pool, which once consisted of expensive Catalina tile, now consists
of a pockmarked ring of devastation. The kind left behind when someone,
say, attempts to "bust" a "mean" "grind." Shortly before possibly
"catching" some "big air." Are you following me?

I mean, there's a connection here, and I think you guys can help me put
this together, am I right? Hopefully you have a plausible explanation
for the pool situation, or lack thereof. If not, before putting my pants
back on, I'm going to remove the belt and apply it to you guys in a
"whooping" that -- should the neighbors hear -- will most certainly
result in police intervention, 'kay?
