It's the greatest thing in the world!

There are a lot of us who love the *WarCraft III* engine but we say to
ourselves, "I sure wish I could play my favorite *Starcraft* mod on
here," by which I mean the mod that allowed you to play my original
*C&C* total conversion of *WarCraft II* in the *Starcraft* engine.

*But now you can!*

It's a complete, true-to-life conversion that authentically replicates
my efforts to replicate my replication of the original *Command &
Conquer*, in its entirety! But now it's using the *WarCraft III* engine!

I've worked extra hard to add authentic touches, such as bugs that I
wasn't able to fix in the old engines. It uses the original *WarCraft
II* loading screens with a *Starcraft* Interface, but it's instantly
recognizable as a *Command & Conquer* port ported to a port ported to
*WarCraft III!!* Who wouldn't want *THAT!?*

I would release the total conversion tonight, but when I was trying to
write the website, I got really really confused.

*Starcraft* mod for *WarCraft III* for reasons I'll never understand.\]
