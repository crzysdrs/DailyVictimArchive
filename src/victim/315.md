Whoa, settle down lovergums! A man just can't rush into this kind of
thing. It's okay to play around in quick little *Diablo II* pick-up
games on the Internet, but you don't want to rush into solving the whole
game together right away. You need to make sure she's "the one" before
you jump into that kind of commitment.

Hang on, you two are already talking about the expansion? WHOA bucko!
Time out! Slow down! You're not even sure you're compatible with this
girl yet. It's a little early to start talking about expansions. I mean,
everything's all rosy in Act I, but eventually there's a time in every
couple's life where you get to Act III and all those little freaky
headhunter dudes are chasing you in the jungle. Will your relationship
be strong enough? I mean, you gotta take some time and just *be*
together, sharing phat l3wt together, you know, get to know each other
before you start tackling expansions together.

Now, let's talk for a second about what character class you're going to
be. A Paladin? Good choice! A Paladin's a giver. You'll be healing her
when times are tough. You'll be dependant on each other. You'll be
givin' off the auras. Nice work. Yeah, dude, that's sweet. Now, what's
she gonna be?

ASSASSIN? Dude! *Get out now!* Tell her you're gay!
