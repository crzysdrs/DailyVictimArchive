  Observe! Observe the raving fans as they coalesce around my expert rhythm -- whoa
  -- whoa, hang on -- I seem to have fallen into the crotch of my pants and I can't
  get out.

Glitter on, shimmering lights of Palace Park Amusements in Irvine,
California. Shine as the midsummer's moon. Radiate upon the delighted
children's faces as I step up to the DDR machine. My pockets are laden
with tokens. The revolution has come.

Faces twist from delight to fear and back again. Whispering throngs
coalesce around the booming altar of bass. My moves are unprecidented.
*Who is this, the stranger from the East? How is it that his phat funky
grooves do not obliterate the very coin-operated arcade machine from
whence the rhythms flow? Can he maintain this level of energy, or more
aptly, can this level of energy hope to maintain him? He is the
revolution.*

They only fear that which they cannot dance.

Oh yes, I have come. I am the Dance Dance Revolutionary. I have come for
your dancers. No one will be spared. Bring me your finest as meat goes
into the grinder. I shall dance them. Who so ever will stand against the
will of the music? [Just look at trodden who dare speak of themselves in
competitive
terms!](http://web.archive.org/web/20001205000000/http://www.visual-shock.com/ddr/teams.html)

Espcially you, Chango. We've met before. But when we last crossed paths
within the blinking bowels of Fountain Valley Family Fun Center, I was
but a neophyte. Note now my enormous pants, custom-tailored to hide my
vicious knee drop moves until it is too late! The awesome fury of my
patented butterfly spin or backward bar lift is brought to a stunning
resolution due to the sheer volume of my pantlegs, each large enough to
contain my entire body should the revolution overcome me. PREPARE TO
SUCCUMB HELPLESSLY TO MY FUNKY FRESH GROOVE, Chango! I will RIP YOUR
BELLY OPEN and DEVOUR the partially digested contents contained within!

I am the Dance Dance Revolutionary.

When I move ... it's a movement.
