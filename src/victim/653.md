  Early this evening I was bragging about how great a driver I am. And so Ted says,
  "Really? Show me!"


  I fired up *Tiger Woods* and he said, "Oh, in GOLF. I thought you were talking about
  Willy's tractor."

What more do I have to do? I left the box out on the coffee table, and
you covered it up with a *Hot VWs* magazine. I constantly turn the game
on before you guys get home and walk out of the room, but you guys
always put in a different game. Every night at dinner this week I've
been like, "Gosh, that *Tiger Woods 2004* is a great game. *Anyone* can
enjoy it!" And you're all like, "Pass the potatoes, Bob."  
  
 So then Cheez goes out and buys a copy of *Simpsons: Hit & Run*. Oh
yah, you guys are all over that like a rash. I keep dropping hints like,
"The best part of *Tiger Woods 2004* is playing tournaments with your
friends," and you guys are running around telling each other "I just
unlocked Groundskeeper Willy's tractor!" Everytime I hear a crowd around
the console, I run up all excited, but you're playing *The Simpsons*.

Didn't you notice how I taped the Tiger Woods strategy guide to the
microwave and left a copy of the FAQ next to the toilet? Anyone?

The ultimate insult came this afternoon. I had left *Tiger Woods*
running on the machine, then I casually went into the kitchen to make a
smoothie. When I came out Cheez was settling into the couch, reeking of
MiDol, and he picked up a controller. I plopped down next to him and
picked up the other controller. "This is SUCH a great game. You want to
play a few rounds?" I asked, all sly.

And Cheez, he stares at the screen -- like, for a full minute --
squinting. And suddenly he says, "*This isn't The Simpsons!*"

I hate you all.
