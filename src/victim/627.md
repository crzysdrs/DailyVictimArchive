Your "Amish Friendship Bread" confounds and enrages me!

I was stunned to discover that it's not actually "bread" at all, but a
bag of dough! And this dough comes with instructions, a complicated
week-long ordeal that includes such directives as the following:

"Day 3: Moosh dough. Set aside."

I tell you, I'm a gamer! This is all too complicated for me. If a meal
can't be prepared in between rounds of *Medal of Honor Allied Assault:
Spearhead*, then it's of no use to me.

I don't care if this particular Friendship Bread has been passed
lovingly from person to person for over eight generations! A true friend
would've simply baked the bread for me. Now, step aside -- I'm pouring
some frozen peas into a pot of water and raw Ramen noodles to create
tonight's dinner. Away with you!
