For centuries man has yearned to touch the infinite, to achieve a
harmony with the cosmos and – barring that – a 900 mctwist. My own
journey has been long and fraught with faceplants. But I have come to a
special place, between the lip and the bottom of the bowl, where man and
universe become one. It is here that man finds a fortress against
external pain, where the cosmos is clay in his hands. And what more does
any man want, but to achieve karmic balance? Emotional balance? Perfect
balance on a rail? Here, then, is the secret to happiness, little one.
You must think always of the world and not yourself. You must refrain
from longings that do nothing to better yourself. And, you must just
totally BUST a PHAT grind coming off of the platform and go AGGRO with a
360 and an airwalk. That is dope, my child. Dope.
