  It's like whack-a-mole. But with buttons. Would Confucius say that? I think he would.
  You know. If he played Tekken.

  *that’s* ever gonna happen.

Yes, my son. *Tekken 4* is not to be entered into lightly or
frivolously. One must enter into onscreen combat only after all other
alternatives are exhausted. And when one fights, it is with neither
conviction nor fury -- one remains calm and simply opens oneself to the
ephemeral “it” of combat, bending like a reed in the ...

Oh, who am I kidding? I just mash buttons. I’m a button masher. Don’t be
fooled by the outfit or the Zen jibber-jabber, I don’t know what any of
it means and just use it to intimidate. So far as I know, you can’t lose
if buttons are being pressed, so I press them. All of them. As quickly
as I can, and in varying combinations.

I don’t even know what the different buttons *do*. I know that some of
them kick, and some of them punch. Well, look here: I figure, a kick or
a punch is never a *bad* thing. So I just toss ‘em out there as fast as
my thumb can dish it out.

I also like to pretend I’m drawing swirly patterns with the control
stick.

Bust mostly, I just mash buttons. Mash, mash, mash. That’s my advice:
mash buttons. Mash ‘em like potatoes. Hmm -- that sounds pretty Zen,
doesn’t it? Here, hit the gong for me. Thanks.
