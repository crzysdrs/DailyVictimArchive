Hey, I saw that Spanky! You knocked that soldier right off the ridge and
into the roiling sea below. What? What? I see you hiding that bazooka
behind your back! Now you play nice.

You! Hey! With the Panzershreck! You just flung that little man nearly a
quarter mile into the air and *right* into an airplane! Now I won’t
tolerate that kind of -- what? -- well, yah, it was totally cool. I
mean, no! No, it wasn’t cool. He was *trying* to snipe the enemy, not
wash their bomber canopy. Okay, you take a time out. You just sit here
on the beachhead and THINK about what you’ve done. Uh oh, what’s going
on over here?

Tommy? Tommy is that you? You just loaded up half a ton of TNT under
that Kubelwagen, didn’t you? Don’t try to tell me it wasn’t yours, I can
see the wires leading to the detonator you’re holding. Oh, it’s in case
the *enemy* takes the Kubelwagen, is it? Oh yeeeeah, sure Tommy, I’m
sure it is. You listen here Mister, so long as you’re on *my* beachhead,
I don’t want to see any of your teammates -- OR their cars -- whirling
through the air like eggs at Easter. That’s right.

What else do we have here? Johnny will you STOP landmining the tank
spawn point? No, no it’s NOT cool. You guys wouldn’t last five minutes
on a server with team damage on. And -- uh oh, HEY YOU KIDS! STAY OFF OF
THE KUBELWAGEN! -- Oh, oh never mind.

Hot damn, they’re still airborne. Oh, there they go ... ouch. Had they
been able to survive the fall they’d be deep in enemy territory.
