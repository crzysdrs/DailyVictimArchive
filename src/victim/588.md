  Ugh, look, now *all* of Team ManyMojo is wearing two pairs of pants. They're like
  some kind of weird clique or something. C'mon, let's round up the other 20 people
  Team ShakaBooty so we can all go to the bathroom together.

\[Part III of *Dance Dance Story*. [start at the
beginning!](@/victim/586.md)\]

Yesterday I met the man I want to make babies with!

I was with Brittney outside the Whattapretzel at the food court, and
then like some sort of Adonis rising from the ocean he rose up into my
view riding on the up-escalator. [He wore two pairs of
pants](@/victim/587.md) -- how can you not love a man who wears *two*
pants?

Then he offered to buy me a piercing, which I think was an --
whatyoucallit -- innuendo. But I took him up on it. See? \[Points to
belly button.\] And then we made out behind the ATM.

So I said to Brittney, “GAH,” just like that. I said, “Who IS that guy?”
and she tells me that his name is Julio. And it hits me, he’s like the
Julio from the WEST side of the mall, the guy who turns on *Dance Dance
Revolution* for those jerks from Team ManyMojo. We’re not even supposed
to be *seen* with Team ManyMojo, normally I’d throw a hissy-fit right
there. But Julio -- oh JULIO! My only love sprung from my only hate!

This afternoon I stood on the second level of the mall, leaning against
the railing, overlooking the atrium below. “O Julio Julio,” I thumbed
into my cell phone. “WFAT, Julio?” Below me I heard a beep, and next to
the fountain he parted some ferns and there he was. “Julio!” I cried
out. “Oh, curse your team and your Many Mojos!” And then I asked: “Can’t
you play for both teams?”

And he said, “Baby I don’t do that.”

But we pledged our love, then and there, by the light of the silvery
moon print in the art store that had the little blinking LED lights for
stars. But how can a girl from the East Side of the mall go steady with
a guy from the West side of the mall? Which arcade would we dance in?
I’m in *way* too deep.

...did I show you the piercing?
