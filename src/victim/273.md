  See these arrows? Yeh, that means, when she bounces, they gotta jiggle. Watch when
  I move the napkin up and down? See that? Is it hot in here?

Hang on, it's legit. Write that down. This is, whatchacall, a consumer
focus group? And I consume. In fact, I've consumed eight of those little
bitty sandwiches you provided, and my first constructive criticism is
that you could've just made bigger sandwiches. But, where was I?

Oh yeh, yeh. Nudity. I LOVE IT. I can't get me enough nudity. Now so
far, as I see it, your game has it all, with the zombies and shotguns
and real-time strategical thoughtful stuff. I dig it, I really do. But,
it just doesn't get my attention like, you know, a couplea big gazongazz
in a tight tube-top. You know, you're like, "are they gonna pop out?"
It's supenseful. So what I'm saying is, you know -- this game has it
all, it just needs more near-nudity.

What I'm looking for is like Cinemax late at night, but without all that
"talking" and crap. I want G-strings, guns, boobies and uh, explosions.
You put them all on the box cover and I'm fifty bucks poorer, right?
Pass me another sandwich. If you want, I can draw you some pictures?
Look at this napkin. See here, this is her belly button, and these, big
as possible. Both of 'em. Hey... you mind if I keep this?
