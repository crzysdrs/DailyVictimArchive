![](/img/victimpics/apr03/disagree.png) **I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE ISSUE WITH
THE EGREGIOUS CLAIMS YOU’VE MADE IN A PUBLIC FORUM AGAINST THE TERRAN
REPUBLIC**  
 As a so called “punk” who will be participating in the military
campaigns of the Terran Republic in the upcoming *PlanetSide* game, I
would like to respectfully disagree with the comments posted onto this
board by Guest3543.
{% end %}

As you can see by the manifesto on the website, the Terran Republic is
dedicated to preservation of order and maintenance of peace and
prosperity -- values that hardly “bite azz” when viewed objectively.

The poster also inferred in his writing that the skills of the Terran
Republic would be sub-par when held against that of the New Conglomerate
team. Again, while it is purely speculative, I would be inclined to
disagree. Terran Republic trucks with both rocket launcher and machine
gun mounts are capable of such ferocious acts of destruction that any
significant action on the field of battle will cause even hardened New
Conglomerates to call into question the very ICEY HOTNESS of which they
boast.

Totally agree about the Vanu Sovereignty smacktards, though.
