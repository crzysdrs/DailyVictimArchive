You saw the
[screenshots](http://web.archive.org/web/20020826000000/http://gamespy.com/e32002/pc/doom3b/screenshots.shtml),
you know what I'm talking about. *Doom III* will have what I call a
"heightened sense of the unsensed," that is to say, it'll be really,
REALLY dark. This is the great unexplored country in first-person
gaming. Too often we can *see* things, and that which we can see by
definition isn't as scary. Look here, when I stand in this shadow. See?
Spooo-oooky.

In fact, I won't be satisfied unless I see them take advantage of the
new technology by having only scattered pools of dim light amidst a sea
of miles upon miles of featureless subterranean darkness, where dozens
of aimless space marines wander about in pitch blackness firing off
chainguns in random directions while playing Marco Polo with pink demon
things.
