  Oh Link, your wily comical expressions bring me such joy. Whoa, is that schoolteacher
  giving you a hard time in Windfall Island? Screw it, let's bring in the Apaches.

When I found out that [our *Animal Crossing* town had turned into a
wasteland](@/victim/577.md), I knew we had to take action. I blamed
my roommate for [cheating](@/victim/477.md). Once he destroyed the
local economy and put Nook out of business, I’m sure the place turned
into a regular Flint, Michigan. And after that? Bartertown from the Mad
Max movies.

Look guys, if we want to be serious about saving this town, we need to
kick off Operation Animal Freedom. Check it, I ganked a map of the town
layout from the remains of the police station. You two are the “Alpha
Team,” Dennis and I will be the “Delta Team.”

After securing the railyard, we’ll be able to start shipping in
humanitarian aid. Maybe some cherries or oranges. Then we’ll move south
while alpha team moves west to secure the post office. Intel reports
that Scoot the Duck might be encamped under a sheet of corrugated metal
in the city dump, so use caution. Better yet, use your M4A1 and just
pepper the place. He’s a duck. Probably tattooed. Better safe than
sorry.

Alpha Team, after you lock down the post office keep your eyes open for
Spike the Rhino. Just shoot him on sight -- he never DID return the
Pikachu that Mitzi the Cat loaned him. Together the two teams will move
into positions to take the shelled out remains of the museum
simultaneously from the East and West strongpoints. Expect heavy
resistance; I understand Blathers the Owl is hunkered down in there with
an axe.

Is the plan clear? Okay, let’s do it! Hang on ... we can only log in one
at a time. Well, that sucks. Screw it, I’m going back to playing
*Zelda*.
