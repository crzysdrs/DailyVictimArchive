  That was close, I was almost a gonner for sure! I managed to fool them with the
  ol' double-back trick. Hang on -- honey? Sweetheart are you there? Hmm. I think
  I may be in the neighbor's house.

Sweetheart you'll have to talk louder, I'm embroiled in [a vicious
Diablo II encounter](@/victim/72.md) using my spifftastic new
virtual-reality gear! These monster sprites are so big and so real, I
feel I can reach out and touch the pixels! Oh, sorry hon, was that your
boob?

Yes, yes, hand me the sword! It's a high-quality socketed Flamberge with
two rubies in it. I didn't mean to throw it at the entertainment center,
however, a group of Zakarum Zealots were after me and I had to take
drastic measures.

Also, my apologies in advance for when you discover what I did to the
bathroom. See, I was in the inner sanctum and suddenly had to make a
break for it but there was no door in that particular direction --
fortunately it was only drywall so I was able to hack my way through and
into our bedroom before the zombies killed me.

Oh mercy, sweetie, look out! The Zakarum Zealots are back! Point me
toward the front door, I'll kick down the coffee table and make a break
for it!!
