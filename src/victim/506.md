Hey there, step lightly. This whole yard is covered by about six inches
of mud right now. Why? Because I’ve been waiting for months and I
*still* don’t have a copy of *Super Mario Sunshine*. It’s time to take
matters into my own hands -- or, at the very least -- to strap them to
my head.

Here, have some chalk. Go ahead, graffiti up that tree. Done? What’s
that supposed to be, a turkey? Oh, it’s a *moose*. I guess those are
antlers. No matter, watch what I can do with this baby: WAAA-TAAAHHH!!

Yah, haha! Sheared the leaves right off. Some of the bark, too. Uh, I
hope that tree lives. No matter, the point is, your shameless graffiti
is gone! We live in a cleaner, happier neighborhood because of my timely
intervention. Hang on, look! The neighbor’s dog! For some reason the
poor beast is covered in mud. I can fix that -- WAAA-TAAAHH!!

Whoa, flung that lil’ pup all the way across the yard like a wet, furry
rocket. Looks like he splashed some mud onto the fence. I can clear that
right up -- WAAA-TAAH! Damn, those fenceposts are pulling free like pins
in a bowling alley. Oops. I think I just put one through the window. Ah,
the wet, muddy dog is using the broken fencepost as a ramp and he’s
fleeing into the neighbor’s living room in terror.

Hmm. I hear things being broken inside. Well, help me carry the hose,
here. It looks like I’ll have to go in and clean that place up.
