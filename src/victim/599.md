\[Part V of [The Daily Victim E3 Special](@/victim/595.md)\]

Yes, this week, [GameNostril](@/victim/595.md) is publishing its
First Annual TINGLE AWARDS! Awarded be me! [Tingle!](@/victim/585.md)
Fwooopa!

Many people say that they don't understand the rationale behind the
Tingle Awards. They would rather have BORING awards, looking at graphics
and gameplay, like [GameSpy's E3
Awards](https://web.archive.org/web/20030523000000/http://www.gamespy.com/e32003).
But not at GameNostril! GameNostril is the only publication to award
games strictly on a scale of foopyness!

Here's how nominees are selected. All last week, I -- Tingle the mighty!
-- buzzed around the show floor on a motorized scooter with an air horn.
When I saw a game that I liked, I threw confetti in the face of the
producer! Those that didn't cry, howl out in horror, or reach for a SARS
mask were considered nominees! Then I would run from the authorities.

As a result, our game of the show is "Super Value Tennis 3D." They
giggled at me, and they also had a big stuffed dog! Our action game of
the show is "MonkeyStacker," from Cheap-E-Soft. They were ankle-deep in
confetti when I was done with them. ZWoo-oi-oinng!

But now that the serious part of our awards show is out of the way, I'd
like to editorialize. Why is the U.S. Army so uptight? The gang from
Sony didn't complain when I honked my horn and threw giant black bombs
into their booth! Well, at least, they didn't start shooting at me.
Loompah!
