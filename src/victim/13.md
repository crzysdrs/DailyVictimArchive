  Ha HA, foolish wangs! I secretly overclocked the voting script. You've inadvertantly
  voted for me 6.4 times with a single click. Witness my sheer genius! HA HA! Wait,
  I'm overheating.

It started during the Summer of '98, just after I completed fifth grade
two years early. I managed to get a full 2.2% performance increase in
Warcraft II by overclocking my Pentium 90. And those bitches felt the
heat!

Pretty soon I started overclocking anything I could. First I overclocked
my pencil sharpener. I hooked that s.o.b. up to a car battery and it
shreadded a plastic Bic pen in under a minute. Then I overclocked my
clock, now it gets three radio stations at once and completes five whole
days in one single 11-hour period.

Ever wonder about my mom's eyepatch? I overclocked her hairdryer.

When I announced to the university that for my Freshman year project I
was going to overclock my DNA -- the very machinery of my being -- they
laughed at me! They ... laughed ... at me! They assumed the child
prodigy had finally gone off the overclocked deep end. But within weeks
I'd already strapped my overclocked Athlon 900MHz via an overclocked
gigawatt transformer to an overclocked colander attached to my head via
industrial superconductor cabling of my own design.

Now I'm capable of over 360 seperate erections a minute. WHO'S LAUGHING
NOW, University of Iowa? Also, my overclocked refrigerator can freeze a
human solid in under 14 minutes.
