The usual shock and horror, you know, I expected that. And confusion.
Terror. People standing on their chairs to get away from me. A few
seemed to just find the whole thing funny, so yes, some laugher. Some
tears.

But nobody thought to ask me *why* I buested into the second session of
Organic Chemistry class on all fours and just started chompin' ankles.
So I'll tell you.

You ever start a 160MB download and then leave to go to a four-hour
class expecting that it would be downloaded by the time you're done? And
then, did you ever decide to check out it during the short lunch break
you get in the middle of class, only to discover that the download never
started because you forgot to tell your web browser which directory to
put it in?

GIVE ME YOUR ANKLES WEE MAN
