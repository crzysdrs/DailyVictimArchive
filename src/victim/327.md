My pr0n! My beautiful pr0n! 30 gigabytes barely legal xxx sorority
chixxx! Hundreds of hours of hottie-cam archives! Megabyte after
megabyte of delicious -- uhm -- well, there was that one directory
labelled "chinchilla" that I was afraid to open. But, what a loss! Gone
in an instant -- the lights flicked out, then when everything came back
on, I got the dreaded scandisk.

Damn it all! It took years to accumulate such a diverse collection of
adult material! You won't believe the popups I endured. Popups that
popped up popups, popups that popped up popups that popped up popups
that followed your mouse cursor around the screen. It was like the
seventh level of hell, but for occasional glimpses of boobies. For
naught! FOR NAUGHT! My entire pr0n collection, WIPED OUT in an INSTANT!

Wait, wait, hang on, Norton Recovery found something ... oh, there it
is. Hunh. I didn't lose any of my pr0n at all. Well, no biggie, I never
look at that kind of stuff anyways.
