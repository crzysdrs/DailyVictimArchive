No, I will not cease, and I'm not planning to desist. Your software
store, Gaming Gigabuys, no longer carries *Codename: Eagle*, the
smash-packed action mayhem furious crossbreed first-person and vehicular
combat gun shooter. This game is a PC entertainment classic. Your
refusal to carry it — simply because it's two years old and nobody ever
bought it and you probably couldn't give them away — is why we're here
today.

I've gathered up every single *Codename: Eagle* fan in the city —
that's right, *both* dozen — and we're here today to protest your
store! That's right, we're BOYCOTTING this dirty popsicle heap! We're
encouraging consumers not to buy anything here — not that they could,
anyways, because the one PC game worth buying for the last two years is
no longer on your shelves.

You may not think two dozen is a formidable group of gamers, but woo-ee.
You wait til you see us on a LAN. During the infrequent periods of ten
minutes or more between game crashes, *WE ARE HAVING THE TIME OF OUR
LIVES* playing *Codename: Eagle* and screaming at one another in a
murderous rage. You can drive trucks, you can drive armored cars, you
can fly biplanes and bombers and blimps, my friend, OH MY FRIEND, you
haven't gamed until you've played *Codename: Eagle* multiplayer on a
LAN. Besides, the freqent server crashes provide ample opportunity to
eat pizza and drink beer. In fact, the appeal of the game is heightened
immensely through judicious application of the latter.

So do the right thing, friend. Put *Codename: Eagle* back on your
shelves. We're not leaving until you do. Or until we get cold or hungry.
Wait, hang on, Jerry says we're gonna LAN party over at his place —
could you hold this sign for me? I'll be back in a couple hours.

Save the blimp for me Jerry!
