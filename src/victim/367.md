  Okay, if my equilibrium wasn't gone, and the ground wasn't wobbling under me, and
  my eyes weren't filled with tears, and the paramedics weren't on their way ... I
  would KICK YOUR ASS. Are you there? Hello? Anyone?

  armor.

Okay, let's settle this. Let's say a fighter had a good solid Imperial
Dragonscale helm, not unlike my old motorcycle helmet here. Let me put
this on.

\[Muffled\] Can you hear me? Now, I'm not saying that a shot to the head
would be pleasant, but I disagree on your assumption that *Morrowind* is
completely unrealistic. Grab that 2x4, and I'll show you. Let's say
we're in a fight, right? And I've got like level 28 armor. And, you've
got a sword. It would be just like hitting me on the head with the 2x4.
What? What was that? I can't hear you through the helmet. No, I said it
would be *just like* hitting me on the head. I SAID HITTING ME ON THE
HEAD!

\[Gut-wrenching THUD\]

OHHH Oh mother of CRAP you HIT ME! Stop ... spinning. Oh man. Was that a
2x4 or did you just back over me with a truck? Help me get this visor
off so I can puke. Oh .... oh my sweet mother. I think I swallowed a
tooth.
