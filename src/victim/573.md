Uh, no - no. That uhm. I wasn’t actually drooling when you said you were
21 and had red hair. I meant to, uh, hit the exclamation point! That’s

8)~

I meant to type an exclamation, you know, to imply that I was really,
uh, smiling at you. Because uh. I uh. I like girls. And ... you are one.
I think.

‘Cuz sometimes in online chat I get slippery fingers when uh -- WAIT!
No, that sounds bad, erase that message, I didn’t mean to imply that
uhhh. What I was saying is: sweaty hands. You know? ;\*

WAIT! That wasn’t supposed to be a kiss, that was, I meant to type a
smiley, but I slipped and hit the asterisk, I was ... uh, I don’t want
you to think that I’m like, one of those guys who gets all uh gropey,
grabby, uh, you know. ‘Cuz we just met. In an online chat room. Heh.
Okay. Yah, LOL, it is kinda funny. Yeah! Heh.

:Þ

OMG, did I just *lick* you? How did that happen?
