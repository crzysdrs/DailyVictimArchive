Everyone is always giving me a hard time about my fourteen-incher. I
show up at LAN parties, and even my closest friends can hardly stop
sniggering as I plug it in.

You know, I try to tell people, it's not size that counts -- it's what
you do with it. But they don't listen. "You know, lots of places have
small screens," I said once. "ATM machines have only five-inch screens,
but nobody ever complains." They all sniffed at me. "When you gots the
money, size doesn't matter," they say. Anytime the girls show up and
wanna play, my fourteen inch display looks pretty weak -- they just
can't resist getting a face fulla 19 inches or more.

The jokes just don't stop. For instance, the standing house rule at
Vito's place is "Conserve space." During setup they're always telling
everyone to pack close together so that everyone's monitor can fit --
"Except you Jerry," Vito says. "You can spread yourself out, plenty of
room there!" The other guys always want to sit next to me since there's
room for their soda next to my screen.

Well I'm tired of 14-inch jokes at my expense! I'm going to get one of
those huge Plasma screens -- they're only a couple inches deep, but 42
inches wide, baby. They attach to the wall. People will walk into the
LAN party, and they'll see me and maybe a couple of friends mounting
that beast. Seriously. Once they get a load of my 42 inches hanging
there, it's over. It's over.
