So you know how it is, it was Beanie Baby Bonanza week at eBay. Do you
know how impossible it is for an active couple like myself and my
husband to share a single home PC? It's a chore. So there I am, temples
throbbing, knowing that I'm missing my EverQuest Guild meeting because
hubby is on there excitedly telling me that he's got the jump on an
original "Flutter" the butterfly for $65 bucks.

Well, exactly -- I don't like to do it but a woman's gotta do what she's
gotta do. Yeah, the works -- I had on the little white nightie and
everything. "Ohh it's so hot in heee-ere!" I said, rubbing my neck and
chest. Then I turned on the air conditioner so that it rustled my hair
all around my face. "Ooohh" I said as the air breezed through everything
I was wearing.

Once his pants were halfway off I was like, "NOT HERE!" and booted him
(hopping on one leg) into the bedroom. Well, sure, say what you like --
but the PC was mine for the rest of the night.
