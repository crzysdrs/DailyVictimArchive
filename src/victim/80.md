  that happens in the world. Sometimes I think he takes a little nap.

Long time no see, brother in arms! As you probably guessed, my
[long-stading hatred of toilets](@/victim/27.md) eventually landed me
in the slammer. Sure, the toilets had the upper hand for a while, but
when I was stuck in that tiny cell I had nothing to do but stare at the
little smirking toilet and plot my revenge.

They paroled me just in time for Christmas, but little did they know
that it was but the perfect time for me to enact my sweet, sweet
vengeance! Merely by dressing in a red suit with white fringe and my
underwear on the outside, I'm mistaken for this Chris Cringle fellow and
given free access to just about every house in the neighborhood. I fool
them all by passing out video games — I hate to give up my personal
collection but as you know I'll do anything for the cause. When they
aren't looking I secretly bomb all of their commodes.

At the stroke of midnight tonight, Christmas Eve, my vengeance will be
fulfilled! When the timers reach 0:00, while the midnight star is high
in the sky and the savior in the hearts of the people, fate will
demonstrate forcibly the woeful weakness of their false porcelain
masters! Thousands of toilets, shattering in unison! Oh ... Holy Night!
Oh Holy Night indeed!

[![](/img/victimpics/colorwoeisp.png)](@/victim/52.md)**TIS THE SEASON
OF FORGIVENESS, AND I FORGIVE YOU, ISP!**  
 For months I've been [trying to destroy my ISP](@/victim/52.md), and
this morning I awoke prepared to swear a blood oath for its destruction.
But lo, when I walked into my den I saw a glorious light. Green lights
— lots of them — twinkling across my modem! Magical! Oh he has come,
the savior has come! I had full broadband once again. I forgive you ISP,
I forgive you as it is written!
{% end %}

Then I remembered, a week ago while I was in the office of my parole
officer, I had met a strange man who told of his plan to destroy the
toilets of the world. My mind thinking only of vengeance at the time, I
gave him the address of my Internet Service provider and explained that
it had many, many toilets to dispose of. I told him to use extra
explosives. Oh woe to my wretched ways! Had I but known! Now it is up to
me to stop this mad red-suited bomber before my connectivity is again
severed from my faithlessness! I grabbed my broadsword and set out into
the snow to seek out and stop this Santa before it was too late.

OUR CHIMNEY IS INTERRUPTING MY MARATHON CHRISTMAS ASHERON'S CALL
SESSION**  
 What? What's all that noise on the roof? This is ridiculous. I finally
have a full week off of work, and I planned on spending the whole time
in the Lugian Citadel levelling up my level 44 War Mage. Now some fool
is trying to cut in on my action. Well, fortunately I have a backup
plan. My girlfriend has been guarding this house like a CTF base since
we started dating — "You got Dee!" I told her.

STRANGER ON THE ROOF WAS DRESSED IN RED — HE WAS GOING TO TRY TO TAKE
THE BLUE FLAG — DON'T YOU SEE I HAD NO CHOICE?**  
 Don't get all high and mighty with me, you stupid bird! Or ... mammal!
Whatever you are. I heard him coming in through the secret roof
entrance. I instinctively grappled up there, saw a flash of red, and
that was it — you know — the old instincts kicked it. I kneed him in
the groin, powerdrived him through the skylight, then suplexed him out
of the second floor bedroom window.

[![](/img/victimpics/color14-inch.png)](@/victim/62.md)**SANTA!
OHMYGOD IT'S SANTA! WHERE THE HELL IS MY NEW MONITOR SANTA?**  
 For years I've suffered with this little bitty 14-inch monitor, and
I've hoped and prayed to get a new one for Christmas. Well, while
walking back home from another humiliating LAN party, I see some chick
suplex Santa out of her window. She was ruining my chances for getting a
flatscreen! I grabbed his broken body and knew I could score major
points by rescuing him. But, I didn't want to take him to the hospital,
because if they fixed him up he might give all his presents to sick
patients or needy children. I've seen it happen. No, there was only one
possible person who could bring him back to consciousness better than
before...

[![](/img/victimpics/colorappliances.png)](@/victim/34.md)**AT LAST!
ANOTHER LIVING SUBJECT WITH WHICH TO TRY MY OVERCLOCKING EXPERIMENTS
ON!**  
 Hello, hello, are the smelling salts working? Can you hear me? Ah good,
I hesitated to slap you with the spatula again as I'd already left a
mark. Now then, can I be frank? What's your goal in life? To blow up
toilets, you say? I should have guessed thanks to the plunger and the
explosives. Well, what if I were to tell you that you could blow up
twice as many toilets in just 33% of the time? It's possible, thanks to
the Pentium 4 NetBurst architecture and 28-stage hyperpipelined,
superscaler, out of order chip design. That's right, I can supe you up
to 1.7 or even 2 GIGAhertz! Don't try to struggle, I've strapped you
down tight. Ordinarily I'd need a thunderstorm to generate the power
necessary to overclock your DNA, but being winter and all, that's not
likely. Instead, I've hacked into the television studio and aimed their
microwave transmitter dish at the local power line transformer outside.
Soon it will overheat and explode, arcing 1.21 gigawatts of power at the
nearest metallic object — the lightning rod attached to my bedroom!
Prepare for PENTIUM 4 POWER!

[![](/img/victimpics/colorbored.png)](@/victim/74.md)**HONEY, I KNOW
YOU'RE UPSET THAT YOU WON'T GET DEUS EX FOR CHRISTMAS, BUT THINGS COULD
BE A LOT WORSE.**  
 For instance, take a look at the guy who came into the hospital while I
was working my shift this evening. He claims he was struck by lighting,
but of course, there wasn't a storm in the area tonight. Totally
delirious. Says he was trying to track down Santa Claus, and he was
following the tracks in the snow leading up to some house, when suddenly
there was some bolt of electricity that hit the broadsword he was waving
around. Then he got all frantic, foaming at the mouth, claiming that
Santa had placed bombs in the toilet of his Internet Service Provider.
Well, clearly he was a crackpot, but you know, we always have to check
stuff like that out. I called the tech support line of his ISP but
nobody answered.

&nbsp;

{% css_class(class="left clear") %}
[![](/img/victimpics/colorjolt.png)](@/victim/46.md)**THE RINGING OF
THE TECH SUPPORT TELEPHONE AWAKENED ME ONLY MOMENTS BEFORE THE
DISASTER**  
 I must not have had enough caffeine because I remember shortly after
that Santa guy visited and gave me a used copy of Half-Life that I
must've dozed off while sitting on the toilet but I was awakened hours
later by the ringing of the tech support line and my head shot up like a
rocket but fortunately I had brought a two-liter bottle of Mountain Dew
into the bathroom with me so I started chugging it to make sure I had
enough energy to handle the crises but you know how that stuff gives you
gas and I didn't think it was a big deal but suddenly when I let it rip
it was as though a bomb had gone off, and then next thing I know I was
hurtling through the drywall and skyward I swear I'm not making this up
from now on I'll stick to coffee instead of carbonated beverages.

[![](/img/victimpics/colordrnote.png)](@/victim/68.md)**SWEETHEART,
JUST BECAUSE A TOILET LANDS ON THE ROOF OF MY DORM ROOM DOESN'T MEAN WE
SHOULD STOP MAKING OUT.**  
 You understand, I finally got my dumbass roommate out of here for
Christmas break, so I have a window of about a week to engage in some
hardcore nookie. So no, I don't think a toilet changes anything. Look,
toilets are always flying all over the place. Don't you see the news?
Toilets everywhere. One was bound to land on our — oh, there are pants
attached to it — well, that's mighty weird. That would imply that some
guy without pants is still possibly hurtling through the air somewhere.
But seriously, let's ask ourselves: is that any reason to put your shirt
back on?

[![](/img/victimpics/colormymom.png)](@/victim/42.md)**I SAW MY MOMMY
KISSING SANTA CLAUS, BUT HIS PANTS WERE MISSING WHEN HE ARRIVED,
CONTRARY TO WHAT YOU'RE HEARING ON THE TRIBES SERVERS**  
 Since the rumors are already flying around, I just wanted to clarify.
Yes, a gentleman did indeed fly through her bedroom window. But, I
assure you, he was missing his pants *before* he arrived. It's not like
my mom goes strippin' the pantaloons off of any creep who flies through
the window late Christmas night. She *insists* they knock most of the
time. I swear.
