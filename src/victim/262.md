I turned *NASCAR 4* on sim mode and picked my car and I had a custom car
and it was spraypainted with the powerman 5000 logo and it was green and
it was black and it had my favorite number and I picked the Daytona 500
and I qualified really high and then I was gonna race and then the dude
said gentlemen start your enginges and so I did and then dad plugged in
the little refridgerator in the computer room so he could have cold beer
and then I drove fast and I was in 8th and then there was the fourth
corner on the 20th lap and I punched it and I was in 7th and then Dale
Earnhardt Jr. was riding my butt and I bumped him hard and then he
passed me and then I smacked the wall and then I was in tenth but then I
made an inside move and then dad cranked up the air conditioner and said
it wasn't the heat it was the humidity and there was a wreck and then
there were flags and I didn't pass the guy until the flags were gone and
then I had to pit and then Dad turned on the fan and the stereo and the
widescreen TV and the VCR and started watching Beetlejuice and then I
drove fast and I passed the green car and then I was in 5th and then I
took a corner really really good and then dad turned on the other TV so
he could see the ballgame and started using the hairdryer and then
everything went all daaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrkkkkkkk!! \[breathes\]

**And Now, In the Interests of Equal Time, A Rebuttal from Joshua's
Dad:**
