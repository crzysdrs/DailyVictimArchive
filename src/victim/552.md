Whoa, hey, Ray — before you go inside, I gotta tell you, CyberSlam
Games and Coffee hasn’t been itself this week. Here, look through the
window with me. See ‘em? Those guys aren’t playing *Counter-Strike*. Oh
no. Those warmongers are all about *Battlefield 1942*.

It started with that guy — no, the tall guy in the tie. He [founded the
ultimate *Battlefield* team](@/victim/551.md) in order to win some
sort of tourney. He’s relentless. He and his buddies confiscated the
eight machines behind the espresso bar and turned the place into the
Cabinet War Room.

See? They’ve got maps all over the walls. Between rounds the whole team
does push-ups. They’re freaks — they play *Battlefield* all hours of
the day and night! Not like us normal people who play *Coutner-Strike*
24/7. I mean, look at that one guy! He’s got a *parrot* on his shoulder.

Now look, they’re drawing all over their maps with dry erase markers.
See? They’ve got the whole map gridded with numbers and codes. This
morning, the guy with the fuzzy hat led them in prayer and then they all
piled into the bathroom stall. The captain yelled “CLEAR!” and then they
kicked open the doors and ran into position to their computers
two-by-two. And there! The guy with the tool belt pointing at the model
of a tank with his pencil? Stay away from him! He’s been drinking the
Schnapps since 3 PM. At dinner he clubbed Marty with a sausage because
he sat down at the guy’s computer for a round of CS.

So, here’s what I’m thinking. They’ve got this huge tournament this
weekend. We can’t let them win, man. If they win, they’re gonna be in
the pro circuit forever. That means even MORE training — we’ll never
get our LAN center back. We gotta put our heads together and find a way
for them to go down. The weakest link is probably the guy in the
button-down shirt — Crenshaw’s his name — he keeps [running over
teammates with a jeep](@/victim/458.md).

I think it’s time to start “Operation Mata Hari.”
