blurb: >
  A camper is holding a rocket launcher that holds eight rockets. Two chumps below
  him are running for a single shield belt. Assuming they get there in five seconds,
  and it takes one second to load each rocket, and the camper can hit someone 25%
  of the time, will the camper kill the chumps?

It was during the math part of the exam. When I wasn't playing Unreal
Tournament the past couple of months I had studied like a madman, right?
But, you know, my nerves and number twos were frayed. I got through the
first page and I was sweating bullets. I was certain I was going to get
owned. It was only gonna get tougher, you know?

But, the next page started with some trigonometry. You know, "figure out
the side of a right triangle" stuff. Total cake. I practically figured
it out in my head. The second one was also easy -- I hardly needed to
take notes, it was just like an exponential question that was in my
study guide. "KILLING SPREE!" I thought to myself.

The next question looked like it was going to be tough -- it was one of
those word problems featuring a spoon factory and machines stamping out
spoons at different rates. At first it looked like I'd have to spend
fifteen minutes algerbrizizing that stuff, but then I looked at the
answers, eliminated a couple, and figured out what the answer was with
logic. "RAMPAGE!" I mouthed, silently pumping my fist.

I was on a roll. The next question was cake. I had to find the average
of all the even integers between -5 and 7. Those bastards were trying to
fool me into leaving out the zero. I wasn't fooled. I marked down the
answer and realized that I was already halfway through the section and
riding on an almost perfect score. "DOMINATING!" I whispered to myself.

Then came the quantitative comparisons. I'd had a lot of trouble with
these while studying but the ones in the test were just like my
examples. Two more questions down, a near perfect score, with plenty of
time left. I leaned over and rasped "UNSTOPPABLE!!" to the kid next to
me. He kinda looked freaked out. I dunno.

Next page. I was almost through. Whammo -- really tough word problem.
Big paragraph of text. I wrote down like six different equations. This
one had it all. I thought I needed to just skip it and move on ... but,
would I stop a killing spree in *Unreal Tournament*, just cuz some guy
*might* kill me? No, no I wouldn't! And I was hurling through this test
like a loaded eightball. I snapped my pencil point trying to figure it
out, but you know, *it was really just some square roots*. I figured out
an answer, looked at the choices, and there it was. I had it! I had it!

I leapt out of my seat, sending pencils flying in every direction.
"GGGOOODDDLLIIIKKKEEE!!" I hollered at the top of my lungs. Kids were
screaming and hitting the floor in a panic.

They didn't even give me a *chance* to try the English section.
