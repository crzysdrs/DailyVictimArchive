No man, you name the arena, and -- when it comes to the Microsoft Office
Assistants -- the clip is goin' DOWN. Look at him. He's ... smarmy. What
is with those eyes? Or that metal smirk? Look, Clippy's got nothing on
the cartoon kitty. Check out the way he meows when I get incoming
mail... here, lemme show you. Send me a letter. Look!! He meowed! And
when I spell-check, he puts on little glasses. The paperclip just bends
himself around like a Chinese acrobat, it's disgusting. I mean, hands
down, when it comes to Microsoft Office, it's all about the kitty.

Oh ... oh now you want to talk about the claymation Einstein? Yeah, now
he's tough. Like, when you open a new Word document, and he comes
walking in, and drinks his coffee, and then he throws his mug on the
ground? Totally GANGSTA style. Damn, I can't even type an email with
Einstein lookin' over my shoulder. Yeah, Clippy don't got a prayer
against the 'stein. Kitty don't, neither, but I think Einstein and the
kitty are friends. Kinda like Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Rock.

You put them in a steel cage together, hell, even if you team up Clippy,
the puppy dog, AND the little robot guy, Einstein and the kitty would
kick their asses. Einstein would have the clip down on the mat, and
kitty would be trying to pull him off, you know, 'cuz Einstein would
have the chair ... or maybe an announcer's table.

I'm just telling it like it is. When you edit an Excel document, who do
YOU want in your corner, hombre?
