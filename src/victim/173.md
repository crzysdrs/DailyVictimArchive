Dude, just give me the keys!

I've read the reports and listened to the Senate hearings about how
violent video games cause violence, and you and I know that that is a
bunch of garbage. There is absolutely no connection between what you
play on the screen and what you may do in real life.

Or so I thought.

But after my latest six-hour *Crazy Taxi* binge on the Dreamcast, I find
that I can no longer fight the incredible urge to drive like a freak-ass
maniac and peel rubber all the way from my carport to the nearest
Kentucky Fried Chicken.

I have complete confidence that I can make my '79 Volkswagen Scirocco
flip doughnuts while sailing through the air above Harbor Boulevard.

So just drop the keys on the table and back away slowly! I mean it this
time. That's it. Slowly. Sloooowly. Step back... \*twitch\* Clear a path
to the front door...

BECAUSE I HAVE TEN CRAZY MINUTES!
