No! Looompah! [There’s no Steve! And this is a Tingle
Tuner!](@/victim/580.md) Tingle is a *good* Tingle!

Not confetti! This is magical fairy magic that Tingle throws in your
face to help fight nasty sword men! Whoop-blllooopah! Whaziiing! Tingle
good!

Hey ... HEY! Give back Tingle Tuner! How can Tingle work his Game Boy
magic for Fairy Boy playing *Zelda* if he takes away my Tingle Tuner?
How does Tingle Tune his ... Tingle?

Who will throw the bombs? All over? Like pucks at a hockey game?

Who will save Mr. Fairy Boy from dangerous heights by pushing him off
cliff into safe water far below? Tingle do, that’s who! Bwoing!

Fine then, take away source of Tingle’s Power! You will rue the day,
Fairy Boy! When Tingle gets down from ceiling harness — er, magic fairy
flying dust flying magic — DAYS WILL BE RUED! Whooompahh!

\[Tingle’s legs and arms wave frantically for nearly a full minute until
the line snaps and he lands on the floor with a thump. To be
continued...\]
