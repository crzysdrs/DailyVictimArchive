Well, yeah, I think it's cool that you want to see more of me and all,
but you know, before you and I get too serious as a couple, I think
there's something you should know about me.

I'm the Naked Guy.

See, at least four nights a week I log into Asheron's Call stark naked.
Well, not naked in real life -- although sometimes I'm in my PJs -- no
no, naked *in the game*. See, I have this character, he's already level
45, and he's pretty much buck nude. Big red boots, big red gloves, and a
loincloth. He's a hand-to-hand fighter, he's very popular.

Almost too popular, and that's the problem. See, a bunch of fighters
will be duking it out with a granite golem, and they'll be decked out
and in full armor with shadow shields and atlan weapons, and suddenly
this *naked guy* comes charging into the caverns, screaming --
"NUUUUUUUDDDDDYY!!!" -- and he starts fighting toe-to-toe. But my melee
defense is so good, I survive the fight. Soon the legend spread.

My popularity online as the Naked Guy is beginning to fray my nerves.
It's like I can't have a normal life anymore.

I'll log in and soon I'll be mobbed by people who want to have their
picture taken with the naked guy. They want to group with me and take
off their clothes so we could get experience together. Invariably they
all die without their armor, which leaves me in a bit of a pinch. People
want to know when I'm going to log on, and when I do, they flock to me
as gulls on the beach attack a stray french fry.

I long for the days where I could log in and stroll into town buck-naked
without anyone noticing! But those times have long since past. I have
responsibilities now -- responsibilities to my fans. I'm the naked guy.
I AM THE NAKED GUY.

That is all.
