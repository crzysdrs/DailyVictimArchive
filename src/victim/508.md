blurb: >
  I'll call this movie, "Staring at a wall for five minutes" and this next one, "Dark
  room, good view of player's gun." That, plus the 256 screen captures, should give
  a comprehensive overview of what's to come.

I can’t believe it — here, come to the window! Look at that. No, across
the street. No, not right across the street, across the street and down
the block. No no no, you can’t see through the window, but if you look
at the wide-angle traffic mirror attached to the telephone pole next to
his apartment building, you can totally see through his kitchen window
screen, and in the reflection of his hallway mirror you can CLEARLY see
his PC monitor.

AND HE’S PLAYING DOOM III!

It must be that super secret cracked leak war3z ... thing. Wow, what I’d
give to get my hands on that. But, since we can’t, help me get some
screenshots.

Here, we’ll set my digital camera up on this tripod — get me the
binoculars! Now, hold them real still in front of the camera. Oh man,
this is gonna be HUGE. Stay still while I focus. You know this thing can
take movies, as well? I’ll snap a few of those. Can you stop your hand
from shaking? It’s making the movie all jittery.

I got it! Quick, let’s hurry up and post these on my website. “Exclusive
DOOM III Footage!” “See the game in all its glory!” Oh man, everyone
will want to know how I scooped these high-quality game shots, so
representative of the final product. *Score!*
