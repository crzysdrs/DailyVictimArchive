blurb: >
  Yeah, the sequel is just begging for some X-Treme finger-BMX-bike stunts. I don't
  know how kids manage to pedal those things, though.

I ask you, what's the biggest fad among today's youth? What does the
coveted Generation ... uh ... what are we on? Is it Generation G or H?
Uh, anyways, what is it that our most coveted demographic is into? What
are they dedicating whole toy store aisles for? I'll give you a hint:
Not Pokemon anymore! No sirs, I'm talking about *VERY TINY SKATEBOARDS
AND BMX BICYCLES.*

Now, listen up, I know a guy who knows this dude who has a friend who
knows a guy who works for Tech Deck, the leading finger-skateboard
manufacturer worldwide. Not only do they have the market penetration,
they got Tony Hawk. We already know that Tony Hawk is big in gaming. Can
you see the connection here? Can you smell what the Jay P. Faddington is
cookin'? I'm seeing a line of licensed Tech Deck X-treme fingerboarding
video games across all the major platforms! I'm seeing worldwide media
blitz blowout! I'm talking about the cast of Good Morning America
limbering up their fingers for a live fingers-on demonstration with a
videogame tie-in before millions of credit-card-wielding television
viewers!

Kids everywhere will be taking their fingerboarding hobby to the X-TREME
on their home entertainment consoles! They'll be able to pull off
fingertricks on television using their controllers and hand-eye
coordination that they could never do in real life with their real
fingers and hand-eye coordination! We could even sell special
controllers, ones that have little tiny skateboards attached.

I'm telling you, you run with my idea and by this time next year we
won't be able to see one another for the MOUNDS AND MOUNDS OF MONEY that
will be piled up on this conference table obscuring all from view. We
could take turns slathering ourselves in yogurt and just *rolling* in
it. I get dibs.
