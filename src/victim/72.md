That's right cheesedick, your opinion is inane, ass-backwards, and just
plain wrong! Fools like you ruin this web forum. MY opinion is clearly
SUPERIOR, as evidenced by my long lineage of powerful Diablo II
characters listed in my signature file at the bottom of every one of my
10147 posts!

Tarnhelm is M U C H better for a necromancer than Wormskull. In fact,
its the best helm in the whole game for a Necromancer or a Sorceress. Do
you even PLAY the game? I don't think we need to answer that question --
the answer is BLINDINGLY obvious by the fact that you don't list ANY
characters in your signature file. WEAKNESS!

Now, let's talk about your recent post regarding the Iron Jang Bong,
which you speak highly of as an answer to mid-level characters seeking
their way through the midgame. The Bong is not an ANSWER, unless the
QUESTION is formulated by DEFORMATED RETARDS. I have but eight words for
you: Iceblink, Goldskin, Silks of the Victor, and Spectral Shard. Up
yours!

You know I am correct because because the characters in my signature
file have a combined level of 209. Also, I play on both USWest and
USEast servers, just to ensure that EVERYONE KNOWS THE AWESOME POWER
THAT I WIELD. This is not a flame, but you are a BALL-SNARFING NAZI and
you're so completely WRONG that I suggest that moderators ban your ass
from posting any more of this PREPUBESCENT GARBAGE.

That may be just my opinion, but after all, the proof is in the pudding:
