Every year, right before finals, I get the whole gang together to watch
the entire *Godfather* triology back to back. It's a tradition passed
down from — uh — when I got here. And now I'm a senior. It's my last
*Godfather* night before I head off into the big world. And if you keep
playing *Tribes 2* with the volume cranked like that, you're going to
RUIN IT!

For instance, how about that opening scene. This is exactly how it went
down:

---—

**Bonasera:** *I believe in America. America has made my fortune. And I
raised my daughter in the American fashion. I gave her freedom, but — I
NEED ESCORT FOR FLAG CARRIER. She found a boyfriend; not an Italian. She
went to the movies with him; she stayed out late. I didn't protest. Two
months ago, he took her for a drive, with another boyfriend. They made
her REPAIR OUR POWER GENERATOR. She resisted. She kept her honor. So
they beat her, like INCOMING ENEMY. She couldn't even weep because of
the pain. But I wept. Why did I weep? She was the light of my life —
beautiful girl. Now she will never NEED DRIVER FOR GROUND VEHICLE.*

**Vito Corleone:** \[sitting behind his desk, petting a cat\] *Why did
you go to the police? Why didn't you ATTACK THE ENEMY FLAG?*

**Bonasera:** *What do you want of me? Tell me anything. But do what I
beg you to do.*

**Vito Corleone:** *What is that?*

**Bonasera:** \[Whispering in Vito Corleone's ear\] *REPAIR OUR VEHICLE
STATION*

Please! Put on some headphones out of respect for the Don!
