No amount of tactics, strategy, or forward-thinking will save you. Why?
Because over the past year and a half I've gamed that game to death.
I've calculated the creation time of each individual unit. I've
determined the exact harvesting rate of every peasant -- even my
favorites, the Chinese. Using an Excel spreadsheet of my own top-secret
design, with the help of [the cartoon kitty office
assistant](@/victim/314.md), I've determined the ultimate formula for
developing an empire. I know exactly when to produce villagers and what
to have them do, taking into account over 100 variations of starting
positions. I know what units to produce, when, and where, in order to
advance to the next age as fast as it is humanly possible to advance.
Nay, as fast as *mechanically* possible -- my organizational feats can
be rivaled by neither flesh nor machine!

Thanks to my optimal development path, I'm able to pour knights through
your gates like water, usually before you've even left the dark ages.
Oh, you don't like it? What do you mean you'd rather play
"strategically?" Strategy is the last refuge of those who can't click a
mouse fast enough.
