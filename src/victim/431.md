What IS this? This is IT? THIS is the reward I get for solving every
single skater and every single challenge in Tony Hawk ... a video of the
developers playing *Musical Chairs?*

This is an OUTRAGE! Look at my thumbs -- the outer flesh has been rubbed
raw and the pink skin underneath has started to turn a smudgy brown
color! The undersides of my thumbnails have turned a dark reddish
purple! My wrists tingle uncomfortably whenever I pick up heavy objects!
If I move my neck in an arc of more than 30-degrees it sends a shooting
pain down my spine until my legs go numb.

The other day after another 48-hour session I stumbled out of the house
and discovered that the orange foam covering the front of my shirt had
been leaking from my mouth. Legs reeling with lack of blood-flow, I
stumbled out of my front door hoping to make it to the 7-11 for a
life-sustaining hot-dog and slurpie. I couldn't remember what day it
was. When I got to the 7-11, on my way to the slurpie machine, I saw a
display of milk cartons...

With MY picture on the back.

Undaunted, I bought enough microwave burritoes to sustain another week
of continuous play. I expected the music video that I would unlock at
the end to be mind-numbingly cool. I wanted to be moved to emotional
tears as I was with the ending video of *MDK*. Instead, what did I get?

Home video of some munchwads playing musical chairs. Thanks for nothing,
wad-munchers!
