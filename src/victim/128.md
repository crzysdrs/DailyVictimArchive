A little rap I wrote... in honor of the blue chick defending her base
with a railgun.

Arcs of fire, whistling freely  
 Coating shiny, shiny steely  
 of the platform you once stood  
 Before I made this all MUH HOOD

In the void your gibs go spinning  
 Your flag I hold cuz I am winnin'  
 Burnin' up the server, I hurt her,  
 A blur, a massacre like Ben Hur

Go head and respawn, it's all wrong  
 No flag no guns there it's all gone  
 cuz I got the feet and the speed and need  
 to do tha deed and nab the ammo with tha greed

Uh hunh, uh hunh

Bitch be runnin, machine gunnin  
 I be fleein' she can't catch me and  
 strafin facin' behind with the S key, me,  
 know the map backwards, hit the trigger, gone, WORD!!

MUH PEE-PLE! MUH PEE-PLE!  
 I LOVE YOU! YOU MAKE ME!  
 Bring it! Bring it!
