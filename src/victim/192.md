A friend of mine had [given me some great overclocking
tips](@/victim/34.md), so I decided to supe-up my PC. I even bought a
new cooling fan for my CPU so that it wouldn't burn itself out.
Unfortunately the packaging didn't warn me about what was to prove to be
a serious drawback.

Monday night after work I installed it and booted up. The overclocking
worked like a charm, and the new fan buzzed happily away. My framerate
for Tribes 2 jumped up immensely! I was a happy, happy camper.

But I didn't get to play for long. [The neighbor's
puppy](@/victim/82.md) started barking, and refused to stop. I put on
my headphones in order to block out the sound, but half an hour later
the incessant noise was too much. It wasn't just the puppy anymore; I
could hear howling. Dogs howling -- dozens of them -- from all around
the neighborhood. It was as though an air-raid siren was blasting the
whole town. I tossed my headphones to the floor in disgust and was about
to throw open my window when I reeled backwards in shock.

Six pairs of yellow eyes were staring back at me. Dogs. Big dogs.
Standing at my window. Their tongues slowly licking the glass, their
noses leaving wet spots. Teeth. Gums. Horror. "EGAH!" I screamed.

After the initial wave of abject terror, I scurried to the kitchen and
grabbed some pots and pans. I went upstairs, crawled out my bedroom
window, and began banging my noisy kitchen supplies together. "GO!
SHOO!" I yelled. The dogs below paced back and forth, barking. My
neighbors began to shout obscenities. "BAD DOGS!" I cried. "GET! GO!"
Some dude across the street pulled out a megaphone and threatened to
beat me. I could hardly hear him over the howling. It was like the whole
neighborhood had gone mad. Within minutes the cops showed up, bright red
and blue sirens reflecting off of the garages and rooftops of my street.

Unfortunately it was a K9 unit -- fierce german shepherds started
straining against their handlers, their slavering fangs glistening in
the flashing lights as they jumped and pulled and barked. The police
loudspeaker announced that I needed to get down off the roof and stop
tormenting the animals. I was about to debate the point when suddenly
the entire neighborhood went dark, all but the flashing police lights.
That's right -- we had been hit by a [California Rolling Power
Blackout](@/victim/99.md), plunging the neighborhood into darkness.
Immediately the barking ceased; the dogs began playfully snuffling about
and sniffing one anothers' butts. But of course my night of gaming was
shot -- after talking to the cops a bit I hit the sack. By then the
canine population had dispersed as mysteriously as it had arrived.

Checking my email when I got up the next morning was my first problem.
See, after that I made the mistake of leaving my computer on all day. By
the time I returned from the office that afternoon, my yard had been
replaced by a petting zoo. Animals stood on top of animals. Dogs. Dogs
everywhere. They had found a way up onto my roof -- I don't know how. A
collie was lodged in my aerial, spinning with the wind. Big dogs pawed
around my yard; puppies lined every conceivable ledge. The cacophony of
their howls and barks sounded, at a reasonable distance, like a fleet of
garbage trucks falling from an office tower.

As I drove up, dogs began piling onto my car. A trio of Shih-Tzus were
licking my windshield. I tried to open my garage door but -- shortly
before my view became completely obstructed by a sheepdog pacing back
and forth on my hood -- I saw that a Saint Bernard was stopping it from
going up. Desperately I threaded my way through a crawling mass of
poodles and terriers to my front door. The tree above shook violently
and its limbs were heavy with retrievers.

I pushed open my door and couldn't stop the horde from pouring inside.
"Noo! Stop!" I cried, helplessly, as a sea of fur swarmed into my abode.
A beagle overturned my CPU case, pulling the plug from the wall, and at
once the noise stopped. Suddenly benign, the animals began playfully
sniffing around. That's when I caught on.

I realized the horrible potential of the device I had installed, and
knew that it must never be powered up again on my machine.

So I sold it to Steve down the street for fifty bucks.
