  We're trying to see if the Chinchilla can identify the perpetrators by mug shots.
  It's slow-going and, frankly, humilating for everyone involved.

It's me again. You remember last week I was talking about [that disaster
where my girlfriend's chinchilla got stuck in a CPU
fan?](@/victim/352.md) Believe me, things have gone downhill from
there.

Even though we were able to save the little guy's life, he just wasn't
the same. For one thing, little Bertie skulked around the house and
hardly touched his hay or kibble, which put me in hot water with my
significant other. But, even more importantly, he started to flip out
every time he heard the noises of me playing *Counter-Strike*. I guess
it just brought on flashbacks … the little guy would seriously wig,
jumping all over his cage like the terrorists were after *him*.

After a week or so we finally got him calmed down, you know, by playing
soft music and avoiding the CS for he time being. But Thursday rolled
around again, time for our weekly LAN party. What was I going to tell
the guys? Well, one thing was clear: no speakers. Everyone had to use
headphones, otherwise the little guy would go berserk.

"Look, don't do it for ME," I explained, passing out thick padded
headphones to all the guys. "Do it out of respect for the chinch."

So we all hunkered down around our PCs, even my girlfriend (who's a mean
sniper, I might add.) You really had to crank the volume to really get
into the game, but that was okay; our headphones were all up so loud it
cut down on the cheating 'cuz the dead people couldn't shout out the
locations of the other players. For HOURS we played, eyes locked on our
monitors, faces an inch from the screen, headphones blaring, completely
in our own world.

Then I felt a little scuffle by my feet. I looked down and saw two
little eyes looking up at me. It was Bertie the chinchilla. I slipped my
headphones off of my ringing ears. "Bertie, why aren't you in your
cage?" I asked. I looked toward the table where he should have been
safely locked in his cage.

To my surprise, the cage was missing. The table was still there, covered
with broken glass from the nearby window. A crowbar was discarded
nearby. I stood up to take stock of the room and discovered that my TV
was missing. Along with my VCR and console games. And … my couch. And
bedroom set. Empty white squares stared back at me from the walls where
my pictures once hung. It was gone, all gone! My jaw hit the ground.

"I've been robbed!" I shouted. "GUYS! EVERYONE!! I've been ROBBED
BLIND!"

But nobody heard me.
