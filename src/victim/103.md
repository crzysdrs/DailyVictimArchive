  This is gonna hurt me as much as it does her. But, mostly due to my arthritis, not
  really due to any moral considerations.

title: That "Tomb Invader" Woman Needs a Good Swift Caning!

Hello, young people.

I'd like to use today's forum to talk about a growing problem. And that
problem is none other than that saucy wench starring in those,
whatchyacallit, from those — "Raiders of the Last Tomb" games.

I can't tell you how often I see that young fornicatress galavanting
around on gaming websites acting as though she were somehow still
*news*, much less news*worthy,* or any conjugation thereof. That's
right. Well, I've got some news for that little tart: ALL of the "Tomb
Invasion" games since the first couple have sucked! And they've been
sucking since well before I had my last erection some years ago!

And yet, despite the poor quality of these continuing Invader games,
that pony-tailed sauce, her jumbly bits all bouncing to and fro as she
descends into the nether regions of some long-forgotten race's burial
grounds, gets more news coverage than a presidential election. Well, I'm
sick of it! This Tomb Purveyor woman doesn't need any more publicity —
What she needs is a good swift caning on her firm but pliant buttocks!

And I'm just the man to do it. Email me and let's get this business
started before I break another hip.
