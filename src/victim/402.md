  Hah, he may have just spent twenty minutes kicking the living crap out of us, but
  he left his WaveBird turned on the whole time. That's got to be bad for the batteries.

Check it -- okay, he's playing *Resident Evil* it looks like. Here, you
hold the binoculars, tell me when he's fighting zombies. Is he fighting
zombies? Now? Okay, watch how he moves sideways when I dial "9." There!

Hahah, that's great. If we do it again he'll start hitting the
controller. I consider this to be kind of a meta-game. I give myself ten
points for making him miss a shot, fifty points if he dies, and a
hundred point bonus if he throws the controller down. Wait, what's that?
Is that a zombie dog? Zombie dog? 4! 4! Now we move in for the kill with
the 8 7 8 7! Look, he just turned his back to the dogs, OWWHH! Clean
kill! There's fifty points. Let me know what he's doing with the
controller. Did he just throw it down? Wait, he's smashing it? Oh hell
yah, how many points should that be? Wait, he's going to chuck it out
the windo-

Oh CRAP put the binoculars away, he sees us! Put them down -- He -- uh
oh, okay, pretend I'm on the phone. I'm on the phone, just talking. Blah
blah, I'm talking on the phone, and you don't have binoculars. He's
looking right at us. He's looking at the WaveBird. He's looking at the
cell phone ... Now he's ... can you see what he's doing? Is that a
baseball bat? Uh -- 9 1 1! 9 1 1!!
