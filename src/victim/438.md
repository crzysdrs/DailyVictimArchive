  So that's how I ended up in what I like to call "The Cooler." Fortunately, everything
  I ever needed to know about Summer Camp I learned from "Escape from Castle Wolfenstein..."

After I [busted into camp Chimichango Duke Nukem
style](@/victim/429.md) to rescue our chicks, I found myself in a
seedy adult underworld. When the older kids wanted to play Strip Poker,
what was I gonna say? *Always bet on Duke*. Sure, all I had was a
tee-shirt, shorts, diving flippers and an inner tube, but I figured that
was all the nest egg I needed to get all the girls to, as they say,
SHAKE IT BABY.

On the first hand I had four twos, but they explained to me that two
tens are better than four twos because they add up to twenty whereas
four twos only add up to eight. I guess I shoulda made sure I knew all
the rules of Poker before I started playing. I lost both my flippers on
that one.

On the next hand I was stoked because I had a pair of kings, but one of
the older kids pointed out that his King was better than my pair of
Kings because he was also holding the Ace of Spades. Dumb luck. I lost
my shirt.

On my next hand I had an Ace, King, Queen, Jack, and ten all of the same
suit but wouldn't you know it some other kid had *two aces?* That's the
highest possible hand. I lost my pants.

At this point, I knew cards weren't my bag. I stood up, wearing nothing
but my dripping inner tube, and slammed my Super Soaker into the meat of
my hand. "Who wants some?" I grunted. Then I let it rip, squirting the
whole room. Let's just say that a night of poker followed by some girls
in wet tee-shirts can get a guy pretty excited.

Unfortunately, the screaming of the girls brought in a mob of camp
counselors. They busted into the cabin with the slam of the door, and
they weren't at all happy about everyone being up late and in the wrong
camp. "Who's responsible for this?" they asked. Naturally all the
fingers in the room pointed to *me*. I lifted my hands in a gesture of
surrender, which caused my wet, deflated innertube to fall to the floor,
revealing *everything* for *everyone*.

"Hail to the King, baby," I said.
