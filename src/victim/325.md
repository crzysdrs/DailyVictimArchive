  Okay, we've no evidence that the cat swallowed the cartridge, but we can't take
  any chances. What? Well, I dunno. He's YOUR cat. Start poking his gut.

FREEZE! You’ll need to navigate the room along the pathways I’ve marked
off with tape -- those areas have been cleared. That Game Boy Advance
cartridge could be anywhere, stupid little buggers. I swear they’re as
big as a stick of Dentine gum.

Okay, Harvey -- you’re up. On the count of three you’re gonna lift and
shake the beanbag. Nora? Aim the Halogen lamp at sector C. Ready team? 1
... 2 ... 3 ... SHAKE! Oh hell, I think I saw a flash of plastic NOBODY
MOVE! Let’s all take it easy now, let’s get down on all fours. Slooowly.
Right ... Pete, you remove all the tape, we can’t risk that the
cartridge fell into one of the clear zones. Whoa -- Harvey is that your
cat? Get him out of here -- what’s he got in his mouth? NO!! Stop him!
Seal the hallway! Seal the hallway!
