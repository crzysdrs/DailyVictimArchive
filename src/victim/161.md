Did you check out Gamerama.com yesterday, April 1st? Yeah, it was
hacked, the front page was totally gone. That was my doing! I spent all
day Saturday trying to break into that thing. See, I used that Internet
Explorer exploit to pull a password off of a mailserver to log into the
network pages, and then I spent a few hours trying different URLs until
I got into their content administration system, and then I set it up so
at midnight instead of doing their regular content update, the whole
page was black and said "This page waj 0\\/\\/nz3red by
\[Brofah\]JACKless."

All day yesterday I cruised the forums to watch the havoc I had
unleashed, but instead everyone was like, "That was a great April Fools
Joke!" or "I almost fell for it!" Even the site admins were arguing
among themselves to figure out which one of them had done it.

So finally I was like, "No no! It was me! I'm \[Brofah\]JACKless! And I
owned you! Honest!" but they still didn't believe me. Like eight other
guys ame out and said that THEY were \[brofah\]JACKless, then LOL'ed and
said "April Fools." Damn them all! I'm the one with no JACK! And I
hax0red them, fair and square. Man, what sucky timing.

And another thing. This arrow through my head? It's REAL! Nobody ever
believes me.
