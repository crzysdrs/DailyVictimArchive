What’s that, sonny? Oh, you’re Mr. Big Man with your Internet. You
downloaded a copy of the second *Lord of the Rings* movie, did ya?
Identical to what they’re going to release in films, minus some of the
special effects, two inches wide, and blocky as an Atari game, but
otherwise perfect, hunh?

\[Pauses to spit\]

Well, that’s somethun’. I’ll tell you, that’s somethun’. Now you’ll know
how it ends. I hear it’s got *orcs* innit. ‘That true? Orcs, hunh? Whoda
thunk it.

But get this. You might be clever and all, but I know this guy -- who
knows a guy -- and he’s one-upped ya. Yep. He’s got himself a *Book* of
the third movie, *Return of the King*. Where did he get it? Well, I
dunno, son. Maybe some super-secret IRC room. You should ask around
online. See if anyone’s heard of this “book.”

Oh hell no, I ain’t lying. I seen it with my own eyes. Yeah, I even know
how it all ends. There’s a King, see? And ... he *returns*. But I guess
that’s a spoiler. Okay, you run along now. Run online and see if your
pasty pansy-assed “h4ckers” and “l33twarez0rz” can score you a copy of
*that*.

Jackass.
