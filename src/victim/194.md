  My work here is done. You should all be glad that I use my godlike ping for base
  defense, and not evil!

Beware, citizen! My [extra-low-ping senses](@/victim/186.md) tell me
that trouble will soon be afoot on this server. I'll be the first to see
it, of course, and while your humble connections are still waiting to
hear the news I'll have already sprung into action.

Hark! Double-yew Tee Eff! Someone's shining the LPB spotlight onto the
sky texture — I'm being summonoed to the flag room! This is indeed
serious. I may need to shut down my ICQ and other trivial background
applications that are slowing me down to a ludicrous 5-6 ms ping.

Watch as I grapple into our base. I'm already through the window and
inside the flag room before your game client actually hears the grapple
hook hitting the wall. I'm like The Flash, except I carry a rocket
launcher.

Speak up, base-defending latent-one! For the love of humanity, you type
slower than it took life to evolve on this planet. You know it goes
faster if you use more than one finger? WHa? Say that again — You say
my ARCH NEMISIS is logging onto the server? He's already through the
water entrance? No ... no mere mortal would dare penetrate my back door
... No! It's —

&nbsp;

{% css_class(class="left clear") %}
[![](/img/victimpics/colorappliances.png)](@/victim/34.md)**IT IS I!
DARK OVERCLOCKER!**  
 We meet again, LowPing. For the last time! You'll see that my ping is
almost as good as yours, even though I live across town — how did I do
it? I will tell you my entire master plan before killing you, because
that's how villains operate. I've overclocked my DSL modem to cram
sacreligious amounts of data through my phone lines. They've become hot
to the touch and my walls are smoking... But I only need a few moments
to defeat you. Thanks to my [overclocked DNA](@/victim/13.md) I have
the superhuman capability of logging in and playing five games
simultaneously on the same server. While you may have the advantage in
ping, I am — literally — a one-man army! I control my five separate
game clients using a mouse in each hand, a trackball under each foot,
and a joystick in a place I refuse to announce publicly. Five monitors
surround my swiveling computer chair and strategicly placed mirrors
allow me to see all five games at once.
{% end %}

I thus have godlike abilities to BE anywhere and SEE anything I wish! Go
ahead — for every time you kill me, I've got four other me's with which
to retaliate. Ha ha, take that, caped cretin! Now I have your flag!
Victory is assured and the succulent taste of sweet vengence will offer
solace during the upcoming weeks when I will find it difficult to sit or
go to the bathroom! MWa-HA-HA-ha-ha!

&nbsp;

{% css_class(class="left clear") %}
[![](/img/victimpics/colorlpb.png)](@/victim/186.md)**CONTEMPTABLE
VILLAIN! I SHALL BE FORCED TO DEMONSTRATE WHAT THE "B" STANDS FOR IN
LPB!**  
 Gads, is all hope lost for our caped bandwidth whore? Never! Your
wicked overclocking ways shall be your defeat, nefarious lamer.
Citizens, I will need your help. As his multiple-selves pass through the
courtyard with our flag, I need you to fire rockets up into the air
around me on my signal. Ready? Here he is — NOW!
{% end %}

As I rocket jump into the middle of your death squad, villain, all of
your game clients turn to look at me, and hence each other. What they
get is a screen full of moving rockets — 25 rockets multiplied by all
five clients — hundreds of moving objects! No mere DSL connection can
handle THAT MUCH DATA!

{% css_class(class="left clear") %}
[![](/img/victimpics/colorappliances.png)](@/victim/34.md)**MY WALLS
ARE ON FIRE! MY WIRES ARE MEEE-EEELLTING**  
 Noo! NOOO!! Foiled again! I have to disconnect as my house has just
erupted into flames. Curses. You may have won THIS time, LPB. But I
shall return! Next time the day will be mine. That's right. I'll get
you, LPB. AND YOUR LITTLE FLAG, TOO!
