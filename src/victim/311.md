  Yeah, so, I was at home playing Pokemon with Tim when I saw the riot on the news.
  But I wasn't there to loot me a copy of *State of Emergency*. Then Tim said he had
  a copy all along. Duh! So we played it, but it totally sucked.

The Man wants to keep *State of Emergency* for the PS2 [out of my
precious little hands!](@/victim/304.md) Just because it's a video
game about rioting in public places like malls. As if it's dangerous.
Who wants that noise? It's like I told the lunch table: I may only be
11, but some hardcore poo is gonna let fly this weekend. It's like that
time I was trying to get that Britney tattoo out of the vending machine
but it gave me three \*Nsync's in a row, so I yelled "Calm like a bomb!"
and kicked it really hard. It's still crooked. Kip keeps it real like
that, yo.

Now, [you're my main man on this](@/victim/306.md), you're gonna be
like my trigger man, word. We're gonna put some serious hurt on The Man
tonight for depriving the people of plotless, violent video games. Now,
I've built a map of the mall out of Legos -- see, the little astronauts
are "The People," and I used these Fisher Price Police dudes represent
"The Man." See here? We start at Vinny's Pizza.
[Tim's](@/victim/82.md) gonna be waiting inside with [Sarge the
Puppy](@/victim/82.md), and when the revolution begins he's gonna tip
over the *Cruisin' World* arcade machine and yell "War Within a Breath!"

You and me? We're gangstas, bro. We're gonna *throw a garbage can
through the window!* That's how you start a riot. Word to *everyone's*
mother. Assuming you're gonna be able to hear it over the noise of the
angry mob, I'm gonna yell "Year of the Boomerang!" and then there's
gonna be all sorts of screaming and throwing things. You look confused,
so lemme show you how it's gonna go down with these little Lego dudes:
FIGHT THE POWAH! Whams! Auugh! Smash! Smash! Stuff is breaking! Oh oh!
Pocket fulla shells! Unh! Unh!

{% css_class(class="left clear") %}
[![](/img/victimpics/puppy2.gif)**THE REVOLUTION WILL BEGIN AS SOON AS I
FINISH THIS GAME... OKAY, ONE MORE...**](@/victim/82.md)  
 Me and Sarge the puppy -- uh, Kip says I should call him "Jaws of
justice" from now on -- met the gang outside of Vinny's Pizza at the
mall after school. I went inside and I was supposed to wait until they
threw the garbage can through the window, then I was gonna yell "War
Within Her Breasts!" and tip over the arcade machine. But once I got
there, man, I saw the high scores had been reset. So I could *totally*
get my name in first place! I figured we had time for one game before
fighting the power. So I started playing the game while Sarge begged for
food at the tables. I didn't get the record so I started playing again.
I figured I'd hear when the garbage can came through the window, *then*
I'd start to break stuff. You know?
{% end %}

{% css_class(class="left clear") %}
[![](/img/victimpics/lilbuddy.gif)**I DIDN'T WANT TO FIGHT THE MAN, BUT
ALL THE OTHER KIDS ARE DOING IT**](@/victim/306.md)  
 Kip and I rode our bikes to the mall after school to "steak the place
out." But instead of the steak place we stayed by Vinny's Pizza and
waited for Tim to show. Kip had brought his yellow and purple "My First
Sony" tape player, and when it was time to start rioting (according to
my dad's watch), he started blasting his Rage Against the Machine tapes.
{% end %}

Oh, and I finally found out what "subversive" music means. Kip said it's
music that makes you want to break stuff, but you don't know why.

Anyways, it was time to start the mall riot, so Kip tried to lift up the
garbage can... but it was really heavy, so he fell over and garbage
spilled out. Then he asked for my help, but the can was super hard to
lift. Together we struggled and smacked it against the glass, but it
didn't break. Then we all fell over. So, I started throwing garbage *on*
the window -- I thought it was just as good. Once the can was almost
empty, Kip started rolling it up and down the window. I wanted to help
out, so I started smearing the garbage on the window with my hands. It
was kinda fun.

After a while, Kip started shaking his fists at the people inside the
pizza parlor and screaming over the noise of his subversive music:
"JUSTIFY! JUSTIFY! JUSTIFY!" By this time we were both covered in
garbage. Suddenly, he grabbed my shoulder and yelled, "The Pigs!" But I
didn't see any pigs, only [a police office in a golf
cart](@/victim/310.md).

{% css_class(class="left clear") %}
[![](/img/victimpics/mar02/riotdad.gif)**A MOST CURIOUS THING HAPPENED
DURING DINNER**](@/victim/308.md)  
 I was enjoying the most delicious pizza pie and trying to ignore this
puppy that for some reason was begging for table scraps. Suddenly I
heard a thump nearby, and I saw a couple of children covering the nearby
window with garbage. I couldn't hear a word of what they were saying
through the glass, but they were clearly very excited about something.
One of them started waving his fists, although nobody seemed to notice
the disturbance but me. The lights were warm and dim, people were
happily eating, and "Girl from Ipanema" was playing softly on the
jukebox.
{% end %}

Nonetheless, I thought it best to notify the establishment owner, and
inform him that he should call in the authorities. On hearing this, a
small child playing a nearby videogame jumped up and yelled, "The
Fuzz!?" In a panic, he ran out of the room, taking his puppy with him.
Within moments, [a uniformed official](@/victim/310.md) came speeding
by on a golf cart. God bless the USA.

{% css_class(class="left clear") %}
[![](/img/victimpics/tf2camper.gif)**OOOWWWWHH!! MY LEGS! THAT BASTARD
RAN OVER MY LEGS! HE DID THAT ON PURPOSE!**](@/victim/307.md)  
 After more than [three years camping out for the release of
TeamFortress 2](@/victim/307.md), I've seen some pretty weird stuff
at this mall. But never as weird as today. Round about 6:30, a huge
crowd had started to gather around the fountain near the software store
here. Apparently the paperboy had scrawled a message on the local
newspaper about a mall riot happening tonight, and people all wanted to
get good seats so they could watch. It all sounded like bad business to
me, but nothing violent happened until that damn mall cop drove by in
his golf cart and *RAN OVER MY LEGS*. I think he did it on purpose! That
kind of thing makes me want to break stuff.
{% end %}

{% css_class(class="left clear") %}
[![](/img/victimpics/mar02/mallguard.gif)**EVEN WHEN THE SECURITY OF THE
FREE WORLD DEPENDS ON IT, IT'S JUST SO DAMN HARD TO CRIPPLE
CHILDREN**](@/victim/310.md)  
 First of all, they're very small targets. Secondly, they're very fast.
Thirdly, the parking lot outside the pizza parlor was for some reason
covered in slippery garbage. I must've done five doughnuts trying to run
those little bastards down, but they got away on their bicycles and
headed for home. Little punks. Too bad real life is more like
*Wreckless* and less like *Grand Theft Auto 3* -- it's so hard to run
people down, pounding their pulpy little bodies into the pavement where
they belong.
{% end %}

But, though my heavily starched uniform may have been covered in crud, I
knew that by driving off those kids I'd ensured the peace and safety of
this retail domicile. Once again, citizens were free to shop freely, the
wheels of commerce turning once again on the thick oily shafts of
capitalism. I figured I'd go back inside and make an announcement on the
PA system, so that everyone would know that their beloved mall was once
again secure.

{% css_class(class="center") %}
<span style="font-size:110%;">**Sun Tribune Weekend Edition  
 LOCAL MALL ERUPTS INTO VIOLENCE**</span>
{% end %}
  
 Residents remain stunned after a riot took place at the Palace Park
mall early yesterday evening. A large crowd had assembled themselves in
the center court atrium after rumors spread that several 11 year olds
were going to stage a violent demonstration. As the minutes ticked away,
the crowd became restless and was soon to disperse. That's when a
garbage-caked mall security officer, name withheld, drove up in a golf
cart and announced with a bullhorn that no riot was to take place. Upon
hearing this news, the crowd became disappointed and unruly.

Then, according to witnesses, an unidentified salt-encrusted stranger
who had been standing near the software store cried out, "What!? No
riot? We don't have to take this!" and reportedly put his elbow through
the window of the software store. Details are muddy and few witnesses
can corroborate a concise description of the orgy of destruction,
burning, screaming, fisticuffs, shooting, and looting that followed.

Police are searching for the instigator of the riot, a lanky unshaven
man believed to have lived at the mall for several years. He was last
seen tipping over a burning golf cart and hollering "*TeamFortress 2* is
a big lie!" If you see a man resembling this description, authorities
caution residents to give him any flags you are carrying and to
immediately feign death.
