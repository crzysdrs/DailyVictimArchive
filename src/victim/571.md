Dude ... dude you’re crazy. Ever since you [killed that wizard with a
bag of rice](@/victim/546.md) during that online wedding, you’ve gone
player-kill crazy.

Over the past few weeks I’ve watched you player-kill in *Diablo*. I’ve
watched you player-kill in *EverQuest*. I’ve watched you mow people down
in *Asheron’s Call*. Then I watched your obsessions grow, until you
started acting like [those player-kill creepos](@/victim/324.md).

By the way, just for the record — nobody really considers it
“player-killing” when you frag someone in *Quake*. People just don’t
think that way. Well, *other* people don’t think that way.

Now here, though, we need to draw the line. Because *you can’t
player-kill in The Sims Online*. Oh ho, it’s true. *Sims Online* is
player-kill free. No. No weapons. Can’t be done. No, they don’t drown
when you remove the ladder for the pool. Nope. You can’t trap them
between stoves and then set it on fire. Uh-unh. Oh, you can launch a
rocket indoors and start a huge fire — but nobody will die.

There there. It’s okay. It’s gonna be okay. No man! No, that’s not true.
The little people on the screen are not mocking you with their very
flesh and blood. Not at all. That little man is just making lawn gnomes.
Everything’s gonna be fine, it’s all gonna be fine...
