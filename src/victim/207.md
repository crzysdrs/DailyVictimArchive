Yeah, it was terrible. Poor Charlie.

Started like a month and a half ago. He and his girlfriend were cleaning
up the apartment, so she sticks her *Hootie and the Blowfish* CD into
his Dreamcast and slams shut the door. So, you know, her music is
blasting and they're vaccuuming and doing laundry, and after it played
once he goes to take it out so he could fire up some *Limp Bizkit* and
sure enough his Dreamcast was jammed -- I mean, solid. He even had it
upside down and was shaking it.

So, she says, "That's okay, we can listen to Hootie again." And Charlie
-- he pretends it's okay, you know? He's singing, "Hold My Hand" blah
blah along with the CD but deep down inside he's worried, you know?
Worried that he won't be able to play *Crazy Taxi* that night.

Right about this time me and Joey and Thom all got *Phantasy Star
Online*, that cool massively multiplayer Dreamcast RPG. Charlie, you
could tell, he was dying to play. He would watch us for hours,
twitching. But he gets home and all he's got is Hootie. Now, he doesn't
say anything, but it's driving him nuts. His girlfriend, meanwhile,
doesn't mind -- since it's jammed in there, she just keeps listening to
it over and over, right?

Charlie's goin' berserk, he can't play any games. *Resident Evil?*
Hootie. *Tony hawk?* Hootie. Hell, *Ecco the Dolphin?* Hootie, Hootie,
Hootie. He can't afford to take his Dreamcast to the shop down the
street, 'cuz he spent his last penny mail-ordering *Phantasy Star
Online*.

Finally *PSO* arrives in the mail, and he tries to crack his Dreamcast
open to play. But the more he fiddles with it, the louder Hootie gets.
Hootie, Hootie ... so much Hootie. He can't take it anymore. He starts
beating his Dreamcast against his knee, and Hootie's skippin' all over
the place. "Ho-ho-ho-hold my ha-ha-ha-hand" -- aw Charlie, Charlie went
berserk. He was in the fetal position weeping and cradling his *PSO* CD.
That's where I found him.

Hootie can do things to a man. Terrible things.
