Oh THANK you, *Legend of Zelda!* Before the newest *Zelda* game, my
seething hatred for greenery had no outlet. My pent-up rage against
small, leafy green shrubs and bushes simply festered, my lust for flora
mutilation unrequited.

But look at me now! I’m a lean, green, lawn-mowing machine! I’m like
John Deere with a sword. My prepubescent ages of torment are over — now
I’m a MAN. Even salad bars quake in fear before me.

The world is a better place now that small children are being trained to
grab sharp objects, step outside their house, and destroy every sign of
flora on God’s green earth, leaving nothing at their backs but stumps
and dirt.

HALLELUJAH!!
