\[Sound of birds chirping.\]

\[In the distance, a dog barks.\]

\[Long, unbroken silence.\]

\[Soft rustle of grass.\]

\[A sudden "Thwip!" noise, followed by a soft thump.\]

\[With a cawing ruckus, birds scatter from the trees.\]

"Dammit!"

\[The crack of six gunshots, followed by their echo from the hills\]
