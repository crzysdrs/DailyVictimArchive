If I just keep bouncing up and down on the chair I think I can prolong
the urges -- but man, I've been playing through the last six maps in the
rotation and I'm sure as hell not gonna head to the toilet just before
my favorite one comes up.

I just need to hold out ... another three minutes for the map change ...
maybe 45 seconds of load time ... then ten minutes of play on the
ultimate, perfectly well-balanced map ... and then I can break whizz
like a racehorse.

Sure, I can't hold my mouse still, and everytime someone blasts a
grenade the roar of the subwoofer nearly causes my kidneys to lose it,
but BE STRONG! BE STRONG!

I'll try not to think about how this next map has the one are with the
running water.
