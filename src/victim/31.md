Haha. That should do it! I was a little worried after my WAIT HANG ON
WHILE I CONVULSE that I was playing Resident Evil Code Veronica all
night COME TO ME SUNSHINE PLEASE all night long was getting me a little
TWITCHING freaked out TWICHING MORE because it's this game filled with
zombies and zombies and dead people and zombies that try to kill me with
the hurting BUT I AM IMMUNE WITH THE SHUDDERING SHUDDER SHAKE JOLT ME!
Jolt Cola, I've drunk over four six size packs, that's a total of
something like EYEBALLS SO ITCHY 17 cans of MY HANDS ARE MOVING OF THEIR
OWN VOLITION unable to concentrate but I really want to solve the game
before they come and rip away my flesh through the windows and WHY ARE
THEY ALWAYS JUMPING AT ME! GET BACK! GET THE BATS AWAY! you can't see
them but I can fortunately they can't sneak up on me WHERE!? WHERE! with
the SHUDDERING WHITE FOAM EMINIATING HELPLESSLY MOUTH GET ME AN IV and I
think I'm near the end of the game because more things are jumping at me
so I'm gonna WIN.
