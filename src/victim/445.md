I decided to order my new gaming PC online because I could get
up-to-the-minute parts. I went to my favorite vendor and started
building the best possible PC via a series of drop down menus. Every
time I clicked on the button labeled "refresh price," new components
were available.

Finally I had set up a PC that I thought was pretty good and when I
clicked submit, it popped up a dialog box that said, "New special offer!
Save 10% on antique systems such as yours!"

When I finished entering my billing data, the website explained to me
that it'll take two weeks to build and deliver my system. *Two weeks!?*
What if someone released a game with 'cutting edge' technology during
that time? My system would only be capable of playing *last month's*
games!

My PC finally arrived in a box labeled "Derelict." When I opened it
there was a letter inside warning me that by plugging in my machine and
booting it up, I would make it less valuable for collectors who
specialized in old hardware from days gone by.

When I ordered the machine it came bundled with "Windows MC," a rare
breed of the Windows operating system that was popular during the
weekend when I bought it but has since be shunned by Microsoft. When I
turned on the machine, a dialogue popped up that said "Warning: System
incapable of playing *Star Wars Galaxies* when it comes out." Then I hit
the "auto-update" button and a message appeared that said "Your system
is no longer supported and must be destroyed before contaminating the
Internet." I went to turn it off and it said "unable to shut down
pending state historical landmark status."

I would show it to you, but some restoration specialists stopped by and
are looking into how to best preserve my machine for future generations
to admire.
