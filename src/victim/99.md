I fail to understand how this contraption works, or how it is intended
to give today's youth hours of squealing pleasure. For instance, I have
in my hand one end of the cable -- where does the other end of the cable
plug in? Is this a wireless device? I bought this at the store in
preparation for the California power blackouts that have reduced my
personal computation machine to a silent desk ornament. However, this
particular amusement device came with no documentation.

It was labelled a "Jump Rope." Here it sits. I find that I *can* jump
it, but I fail to see from whence I should be deriving amusement from
the activity. Is there a way to turn up the difficulty?

Perhaps it is multiplayer only. I'd need to find a partner to hold the
other end of the cable. Two possible problems present themselves: First,
how am I to find a partner without any multiplayer matchmaking software?
Second, were two players to each hold on to an end of the rope of
jumping, who, then, would jump said rope?

Well, I see by the mass looting and panic in the hazy darkness outside
that the blackout has not yet subsided. I will now attempt to wiggle the
jumping device while chanting a rhythm-inducing poetic verse:

*Five little monkeys,  
 Jumping on the bed.  
 One fell off  
 And bumped his head.  
 Mama called the doctor,  
 And the doctor said  
 "No more monkeys jumping on the bed!"*

(Monkey = Monkey - 1)

*Four little monkeys,  
 Jumping on the bed...*

Hold on a minute, the physician clearly stated that the simian mattress
antics must cease! Why must they continue? Don't the four remaining
monkeys understand that they're taking their lives into their own little
furry monkey hands!? Where's the violence filter? Where's the God mode?
Noclip, noclip, you damn dirty apes!!

Maybe there's a strategy guide somewhere.
