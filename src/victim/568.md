  They probably didn't understand me, of course, because I was speaking in German.

They seem to be a senseless blur of sandbags and MG42s. I’ve played so
many World War II games, and for such long unbroken intervals, that the
distinction between one and the next has long since faded. *Return to
Castle Wolfenstein*, *Medal of Honor*, *Battlefield 1942*, *Day of
Defeat*....

More ominously, I can no longer distinguish between the genuine events
of the conflict and those that have been rendered onscreen. I’ve come to
understand that the Allies were fighting against the Axis, though it’s
unclear to me who ultimately won. There were also some Russians. They
tended to defend the flag.

I now speak fluent German.

I know the subtle difference between the turning radius of a Supermarine
Spitfire Mk I and the Messerschmitt Bf 109 G. I can recognize their
silhouettes clearly from up to 1000 yards in the fog and gauge the
distances to them with ground-based flak-cannons. I’ve not been outside
for six months.

I know more about the equipment of an American 82nd airborne soldier on
D-day than I know about the condition of the underwear I’m wearing. If,
indeed, I *am* wearing any.

This morning my friends came in and found me playing the original 1992
version of *Wolfenstien*, screaming for someone to “GET THE FLAG.”
