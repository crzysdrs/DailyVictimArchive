  Hmmm. His friend is just running up and doing backflips off of every wall. I suppose
  if "He" is "The One" then his friend must be ... "Number Two."

We have him now. All units, close in. "The One" will not escape the
Matrix this time. Yes, we've pinpointed his location. He's in the post
office, and he's trying to aim and shoot with the analog sticks on his
dual shock controller somewhat comically.

Yes, he's just gone into bullet-time and slaughtered two operatives with
a split-kick. No, no I believe it was luck — now he's just doing the
split kick down the corridor, over and over again. He must've just
learned how to do it.

He's sipping Kool Aid and showing his moves off to his friend from
school. Strike now! He's distracted. He can't figure out how to get past
the tear gas. Wait, wait, now his friend says he knows how to get past
it. They're fighting over the controller. Kool Aid has been spilled —
The One's mom is gonna be PISSED.

Our work here is done.
