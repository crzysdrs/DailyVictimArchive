No. No, I can't. No, I won't swing across on the rope. Right, I know
it's a company "Bonding" exercise, and that we were all given the day
off of work together to attend this "Teambuilding Seminar" here at "Camp
Snoopy Valley," but frankly I don't feel that my specific job in the
printing department requires any bonding. Particularly bonding with you,
Chuck, you sit in the cubicle across from mine, and pick your nose. I've
seen it.

So, I'm going to respectfully pass on the swinging rope. No, it's very
scary. See, I'm allergic to ropes, ones that swing? Very dangerous.

Actually, okay, I'll spill my guts, just like you encouraged us to at
the "pep rally" this morning ouside our "bungalows." You see, when I was
a very small child, I had this terrible experience with Atari Pitfall.
That's all I'll say. There was that pit, and the water, and the
alligators, and the vine, and that crappy flattened red button on the
joystick that my brother had mashed beyond hope playing Space Invaders,
and everything went .... oh, it was -- oh and the -- ohh -- \*shallow
sobs\*

Hold me, Chuck.
