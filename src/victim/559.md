There’s a lot of talk about *Battlefield* among the online warmongers
out there, but what about us *Wolfensteiners*? Wir haben eine kleine
schmackdownen, over here. Teamplay *Wolfenstein* is like crack with a
machine gun: deadly and addictive.

Especially for me. I’m one of the few, the proud, the weeping shattered
remains of a soldier reduced to a pile of cartilage on the ground
screaming for a MEEEDDDICC! That’s because I wield the ultimate weapon:
The Venom Machine Gun.

Oh yes. They tell me that I’m a fool. They tell me that I eat up too
much ammo, that I run too slow, that I take too long to fire. But they
just can’t possibly understand the unmitigated thrill I get, that
sex-like adrenaline rush that pours through me... for those few intense
moments when the Venom gun is firing at full speed. Usually I enjoy
these moments immediately before getting shot.

I have four buttons on my mouse, and with my custom-configuration I’ve
arranged them (from left to right) like so: Fire, Call for Ammo, Call
for Medic, and Whimper like a Schoolgirl.

Well, look at where I am right now, for instance. Across this bridge was
the Axis stronghold, brimming with enemy soldiers like beans in a bag.
There’s no subtlety in my line of work. I stepped out onto the wide-open
shattered rubble-strewn surface of the bridge, Venom Canon hanging at my
side. Then they came: over a half dozen helmeted soldiers, pouring from
the bombed out remains of the old inn across the way. I held down the
trigger, waiting for my gun to spin up as bullets rained down on me like
steel confetti. And then the cannon began firing, spraying scunion like
I was holding a firehose. The very walls around the Germans exploded
into chunks of brick and plaster as I spewed fire onto their positions.
They fell like sacks of flour. “AMMO!” I yelled as my gun spun down.
Then I got hit by a bullet to the chest. And a rocket to the head. A
sniper round to the knee. Maybe a grenade or two. “MMEEDDIICC!!”

The team’s medic stooped over me while six of our guys rushed the enemy
position. I grabbed him by the collar. “Earn this!” I typed. “Earn it.”
