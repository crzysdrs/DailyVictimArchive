  As I slipped out the back window, I saw the Theta Chi's banging on the side of that
  dude's VW. Hah. I'll eat them all for breakfast.

*Hello, Freshmen. This is my last year at the university here, and I
plan for it to mark my greatest triumph. Before I go, however, I have
decided to pass my legacy of destruction on to you. Listen closely. Take
notes. For while much has been written on the subject of skillful
high-speed racing, as we all know,* Gran Turismo 3 *has no damage
engine. And therefore conventional rules of racing do not apply. That's
the cornerstone of* my *school of racing, the Gino School of High-Speed
Competative Demolition.*

*Using my techniques, this weekend's tournament will be mine. When I was
a freshman -- like you -- I was denied victory in the* Gran Turismo 2
*tournament because a senior from [Theta Chi](@/victim/254.md)
knocked me off the road. But this year, sweet vengeance will be mine. At
... any ... cost...*

{% css_class(class="center") %}
\* &nbsp; \* &nbsp; \*
{% end %}

I roamed the campus center lounge trying to find him. Tony Kawai:
Japanese kid. Good guy. Kinda quiet. Kept to himself after [some rumored
run-in with the police and a naked guy back at
home](@/victim/206.md). But this weekend, as the head of the
Audio/Visual department and therefore the guy running the *Gran Turismo
3* tournament, he was suddenly thrust into the spotlight. After all,
only he knew which racecourse on which we would play the final
tournament, and I wanted to practice my moves.

I finally found him in the garden outside of the Campus Center grill,
near the wall that looks down over the patio below. He was sitting on a
folding chair, quietly watching a flowering bush. I crushed it out of my
way and a butterfly sailed off, apparently bringing the dude back into
reality. "What are you doing?" I asked him.

"Thinking," he said.

I slammed my ass down on a picnic table next to him. "Thinking? What?
Dude, this is college." I waved my hand in front of his face until he
looked at me, then set my feet up on the corner of his chair. "About
this racecourse..."

{% css_class(class="center") %}
\* &nbsp; \* &nbsp; \*
{% end %}

*Okay Freshmen: Lesson Number One. Cornering.*

*And by cornering, I mean* slamming your opponent into a corner*. Let's
take a look at my diagram, representing a typical scenario. You're
coming into a corner behind a goody-goodie driver, like [maybe that
bitch in a VW](@/victim/255.md). As you can see here, he has already
slowed his car in preparation for the perfect turn. That's his mistake.
Because YOU do NOT slow down when you're coming into curves, not so long
as a car is in front of you. Nor do you turn. Not in the Gino School of
High-Speed Competative Demolition, you don't. Why waste that precious
speed?*

*As you can see in diagram two, in the next instant you've slammed
full-on into the car that's turning. The net effect is wholly in your
favor; After glancing off the side of his car, your car is now oriented
correctly AND moving slow enough to take the corner. HIS car, however,
is facing the WRONG way and has smashed into the wall where he has come
to a complete stop! Furthermore, he has become an obstacle to all the
cars behind him.*

*You may think this is dirty. But would you rather be a dirty winner or
a clean loser? Trust me, I've been bent over the guardrail before and I
know where* I'd *rather be when the Gatoraide is being dumped in the
winners circle. NO MERCY. NO MERCY. NO MERCY. Stand up on your chairs
and chant it with me Freshmen: NO MERCY! NO MERCY! NO MERCY!*

{% css_class(class="center") %}
\* &nbsp; \* &nbsp; \*
{% end %}

"What's the racetrack, Tony!? TELL ME!" I cried.

Tony dangled over the wall, his glasses falling down a full story into
the bushes below. "You'll just have to kill me," he said, calmly. I
admired his tenacity but hated his guts. Snorting, I hung him up by a
pantleg and left him there.

{% css_class(class="center") %}
\* &nbsp; \* &nbsp; \*
{% end %}

*Allright Freshmen! We've looked at the proper way to corner, and we've
looked at how you have to memorize every single curve and bend in the
course like the shapely bottom of a fine fine woman. Only then you can
unlock what I call the "destructive potential" contained within every
inch of a racetrack.*

*But now we look to our opponents. Three words: KNOW THEIR WEAKNESS.
That's right. If the punk bitch in front of you has a Dodge Viper, you
know he can't corner. You know it. USE it. You know that he's got
rear-wheel drive and when he's in the dirt he's as useless as a bra in a
frat house. Remember rule number one: No Mercy! That's right, you shove
that Viper in the dirt at every opportunity.*

*Sometimes I'll intentionally slow down just to ram him over into the
dirt again. He's over there doin' more doughnuts than the county police
and I'm six corners ahead, crying with laughter.*

*You've got to know your opponent's weakness psychologically as well as
mechanically. Look your enemy in the eye. Find out his fears. Key in on
his worst nightmare. Got that? His worst nightmare!*

{% css_class(class="center") %}
\* &nbsp; \* &nbsp; \*
{% end %}

With that fool Tony not spilling the news on what the championship
racecourse would be, I was going to have to get x-treme like Tony Hawk
on this race. Come the end of the Trimester I was gonna graduate, so
this was my last chance.

The guys in the Theta Chi building were having [some kind of
meeting](@/victim/254.md), so nobody was watching the back window
when I climbed in. As I slipped toward the game room, someone yanked the
fire alarm. All the more convenient for me! The building had cleared out
by the time I crept into the basement. The Playstation 2 was sitting
innocently on a coffee table, nestled lovingly amongst some beer cans
and a bra. I reached for the multi-tap in order to [gank their PS2
memory card](@/victim/254.md), sinking his chances of beating me with
the Del Sol. Find out their fears, that's the lesson!

But I noticed, with a mix of hatred and amusement, that it had already
been stolen.

\[*Gran Turismo 3 Week continues at the Daily Victim! One week of
hardcore racing, backstabbing, and smack talk culminating in the big
tournament this weekend. Which victim will win? Stop by all week to
vote.*\]
