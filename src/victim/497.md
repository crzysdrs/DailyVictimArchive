  Well, curses, now my fun meter is really low. Hey, do you want to watch TV for a
  while? Please? Oh, come on. What if I gave you a balloon?

You fools, you’ve fallen into my clever trap! Sure, [*The Sims
Online*](http://web.archive.org/web/20021023000000/http://www.fileplanet.com/promotions/tso/)
claims to be an open community of lollygagging do-gooders accepting to
one and all, but THAT was BEFORE the terrifying Machiavellian exploits
of yours truly, one Phineas P. Tuttlemyer ESQUIRE!

While you’ve all been milling about wasting your time “socializing,”
I’ve already unleashed my scheme to corner the lucrative Lawn Gnome
market. It began with my own two highly skilled hands chiseling forth a
single grinning Lawn Gnome, his dark soul visible beneath his smiling
countenance only should you stare into his harrowing dark eyes, like two
bottomless portals into an abyss of lonely pain and suffering.

I sold him at two Simoleans under the cost of a normal Lawn Gnome. The
loss was but a wee bump on the unholy road to success. For soon -- one
lawn gnome at a time -- I had established a precedent of quality
workmanship at lower cost. I was soon able to hire more workers to slave
away Chiseling Lawn Gnomes while I manufactured a unique multimedia
lifestyle-branding campaign featuring abstract photos of Gnomes in
trendy clothes with the catchy and ultimately meaningless new slogan
“Gnome On,” now available on designer shirts worn by professional
athletes. Soon I had hundreds of gnomes available at my disposal and I
all but dumped them on Gnome-needy marketplaces at far below cost,
buying up competitors and their operations as they began to falter under
my virtual Gnomealanche of goods.

Once my Gnome name was ubiquitous and quality no longer mattered, I
unveiled new lines of designer Gnomes priced at ten times their value,
coveted by people because of the brand image. I’ve also unleashed a
subscription Gnome plan, a pay-per-gnome plan, and I’ve introduced new
Gnome-making materials that decay after only a few months use. Profits
are high, wee man, and sales are quadrupling with each quarter, while
the competition is powerless within my Lawn Gnome grasp! MWA-HAAH! HAH!

Whew, all this taunting, mockery, and gloating has lowered my bladder
meter to unacceptable levels. Pardon me while I make my little man pee.
