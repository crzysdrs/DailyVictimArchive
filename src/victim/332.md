I'd been following the development of *[Freedom
Force](http://web.archive.org/web/20020403000000/http://gamespy.com/reviews/march02/ff/)*
ever since, hell, since GameSpy posted that big article from last year's
E3. I knew it was going to be a cool roleplaying game but I didn't know
it was going to be a total sellout sorta thing.

I tried getting it from EB, but they didn't have it. So I walked all the
way across the mall to Software Etc, and they had just sold out as well.
Hell, now it was a crusade. I hopped into my truck and headed over to
Metro Pointe mall and Gaming GigaBuys, which I usually avoid because of
that [unstable guy in a bear suit.](@/victim/106.md) There was a mob
of people but no *Freedom Force.* What's the deal?

In desperation I called my girlfriend. Coincidentally, she was shopping
at Palace Park mall across town. "Need ... *Freedom Force!*" I gasped.
"Boyfriend needs *Freedom Force* badly. Boyfriend's life force is
running out!"

I heard the rest of the story when I got home later that night. She
sauntered into Software Etc. and leaned over the counter, chest thrust
outward. "Do you have *Freedom Force?*" she asked. The kid behind the
counter shook his head no, they had sold out as well.

Then she slumped her shoulders and began the pouting. Lower lip: FULL
extension. Upped the pitch on her voice. "What am I gonna doo-ooo?" she
pleaded, blinking. The guy behind the counter broke into a hot sweat,
then rushed into the back room and emerged with a copy moments later. He
proceeded to sell her his manager's reserved pre-order copy, his head
darting back and forth to make sure nobody noticed. "Thank yooo-oou!" my
girlfriend chirped. Then she stomped out of there like a commando.

That sort of thing -- well, that's just not an option that I, as I guy,
even had. It kinda makes me feel a little dirty, you know? But, on the
other hand, we got *Freedom Force*. It's kind of like my girlfriend has
... *super-powers*. Hmm! She DOES wear tight pants...
