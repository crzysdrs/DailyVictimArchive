Oh sure, me and the other driver walked away from it, but that's just
what I'm saying. I've played them all: *Grand Theft Auto*, *Midtown
Madness*, you name it. And from countless hours of experimentation, I
can tell you one thing: that auto accident I just got into on the
crosstown freeway? NOT AT ALL REALISTIC.

For one thing, all of the parts stayed *on the cars*, except for some
bits of broken glass and part of a taillight. I don't need to tell you
how fishy *that* is. I shoulda seen fenders flying, and my door
should've been four lanes over. Also, my hood should've shot up 20,
maybe 30 feet in the air. Instead, it wrinkled a little. *AS IF*.

But the real kicker? *Neither of our cars exploded!* That's right, they
both just sorta ... crunched. Hello? Look, I know auto-accidents, I've
caused probably a hundred thousand of 'em on my PS2. And that, sir, was
no auto-accident.

I shoulda been careening through the air end-over-end, shooting auto
parts in all directions before bursting into a flame white ball of flame
and stringy ribbons of human remains.

What a rip.
