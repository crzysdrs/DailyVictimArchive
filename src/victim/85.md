We're a brotherhood, here. Let's not forget that. We are the BEST. And
let's not forget what got us here. Let's not forget those values that
are so prominently displayed on our web page flash intro. Courage.
Honor. Dignity. Respect. Clan Omega Ops puts the "team" in TeamFortress.

Now, I know that we've never seen one another face to face. I know that
we've just met in chat rooms and played together online. But I consider
each and every one of you my brothers in arms. And as Captain of this
clan, it hurts me everytime one of my clanmates is hurt. But again I
submit for you our four core values, two of which are *dignity* and
*respect*. If you don't respect ME, then you don't respect the
BROTHERHOOD. And if you don't respect that -- well, we might as well
just give the other team our flag.

Let's pull together, team. We can recover from this. But I'm going to
need each and every one of you, sight unseen, to trust me on this. I am
your respected leader! I founded Clan TF Omega Ops with honor in mind.
Are you with me? Are you behind me?
