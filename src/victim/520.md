ABOUT THAT. I FILLED UP MY MARIO SUNSHINE HOSE DEVICE WITH GRAVY IN AN

ON A SOCOM NAVY SEALS SERVER TO KEEP ME COMPANY. RANDOM PEOPLE ON THE
INTERNET HAVE STARTED TO SEND ME FOOD, BUT I ASK YOU, HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO OPEN A TIN CAN OF CRANBERRY SAUCE? WITH MY TEETH? CAN’T YOU PEOPLE
*THINK?* AH, I SEE IN RESPONSE YOU’VE DECIDED TO SHOOT ME AND PUT A
