\[The sound of a great Gong reverberates through the still air\]

Hello. I wish to speak today on behalf of all of us who have chosen to
walk the way. You see, I have mastered the Martial Arts after a lifetime
of rigid discipline and an untold number of wire-fights.

And, just as [the NFL has decided to crack down on unrealistic videogame
portrayals](https://web.archive.org/web/20021205000000/http://gamespy.com/bizbuzz/december02/bizbuzz44/),
so too do I ask that the Martial Arts community come forward and ask
that videogame publishers de-emphasize the violent content of fighting
games. They should focus instead on the camaraderie, concentration, and
discipline.

Martial arts isn’t just about drinking plum wine, staggering around, and
kicking someone in the kneecaps until their leg bends backwards in a
gag-inducing display of human frailty and pain. It’s also about
*breathing*. And concentration. Rarely does one concern oneself with
“Fatalities,” as seen in *Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance*. The Martial
Arts are getting a bad name! And they spelled “Combat” wrong!

It is not about [Button Mashing](@/victim/518.md). Well, not ALL the
time.

No, children. Like the NFL, I’d like to encourage Game Developers to
step back and make combat games that are more a *simulation* of the
actual sport, and less a glorification of the unfortunate violence that
sometimes erupts when you rush a person with a katana swinging to and
fro as would the darting head of a stinging serpent. The removal of
limbs and gushing of life-sustaining fluids into the unremorseful earth
from whence they came is but one facet of a beautiful and ancient
tradition.

If anyone would like to disagree, I will press a special combination of
buttons that will allow me to rip off their head with their spine
attached. Thank you.

\[Once again the sound of a great Gong echoes through the air, sending a
flock of cranes skyward amidst the fluttering of wings. When stillness
returns, the old man is gone.\]
