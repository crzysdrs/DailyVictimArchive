  Hang on, Frenchie is on the other line. She said that she heard from Lewis who talked
  to Carmine that Rachelle heard from Susan's caterer that Pete is a quad-whore, and
  I asked her to call me back if she heard any more.

So, there I was, I was dropping off some fresh tomatoes and a copy of
the Half-Life CD key that I borrowed over to Delores and while she went
off to the other room I saw her husband Bob -- that's right, Bob from
the PTA meeting -- playing Team Arena.

So he doesn't know I'm standing at the door and I see him rocket jump up
to the top of a door frame and look down into the room, and then he just
waited there. So I say, really loud I say, get this, "Hi Bob!" and you
shoulda seen him jump! Well, in real life, too, but in the game he
jumped down from the door frame and acted like he was going for the red
armor all along. It was precious!

Yeah, I always knew he was a camper, but Delores wouldn't have any of
it, oh no. But I know it. And that [No Good Son of
Theirs](@/victim/92.md) was still down in the basement, playing
EverQuest. I bet he was camping the Jboots or something. I wouldn't put
it past him! It's a whole family of campers, I tell you! There goes the
neighborhood.
