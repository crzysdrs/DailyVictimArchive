Gather round everyone, gather round and listen up. Your regular
tournament host, Tony Kawai, [met with an unfortunate
accident](@/victim/256.md) this week. That puts me, as vice-president
of the audio-visual department, in charge of this shindig. Running the
first annual *Gran Turismo 3* Tournament on this campus is an
unprecedented opportunity for a Sophomore like me, and I have decided to
take full advantage of this by abusing my authority and scrounging up
over $60,000 worth of a/v equipment from all over the campus.

You will note the four center consoles from which the finalists will
compete. Each of these seats is wired up to the 1000 watt auditorium
speakers. Ordinarily these systems are used to provide audio for
hundreds of people. However, tonight it will be under your butt. I
suggest you wear earplugs. Earlier I had the cafeteria lady who serves
the french fries sit down in the seat here and fire up the Austin Mini.
The roar of the engine popped her bra and shoes right off. She started
speaking in Spanish, weeping and pleading for redemption as she crawled
for the door, her legs suffering from temporary paralysis.

You will also note that I raided the main conference rooms of the admin
building. Each and every seat is equipped with its own 42" Plasma
screen, placed right in front of your face. I have also equipped every
chair with its own Logitech GT force-feedback steering wheel and I've
bolted the pedals onto the floor -- hello, question from [Team
VW?](@/victim/255.md) Ahh, you've brought your own homemade racing
controller with a chain-link wheel, horn, and cruise control? Okay,
well, that's not regulation, but input is input. Plug 'er in.

Now then, I understand there are some side-bets to be made. Our man Tony
wouldn't have allowed it, as it's against campus policy. However, I'm
also a member of the young college entrepreneurs club, and I can smell
money like sharks smell blood. So for a 5% commission I'll gladly
officiate any bets you'd like to make. Ah, look here, the VW guy is
putting up $200 bucks that says his VW will win. That's right! Dig out
those wallets! 'specially you, [Pre-Law dude](@/victim/257.md),
everyone knows you're loaded. Hang on, something just fell out -- hey,
it looks like [Theta Chi's missing memory card...](@/victim/254.md)

Oh God, whoa! Stop it guys! Don't get blood on the plasma screen! Put
the chair down! Break it up -- Save it for the track! *Save it for the
track!*

Let's get this tourney underway, all right?

\[*Gran Turismo 3 Week climaxes at the Daily Victim! One week of
hardcore racing, backstabbing, and smack talk culminating in tomorrow's
big tournament. Which victim will win? Tune in this weekend to find
out!*\]
