Hey, I'd shaddup if I knew what was good for you, punk. I watched the
whole thing from our base's generator tower. You were weaving like it
was basket-day in Home-Ec up there. And where's your bombardier, mister?
I'll tell you where he is, he's on the other side of this hillock puking
his guts out after you dusted the bridge UPSIDE DOWN.

And what's this I see in the rubble? Would you care to explain that sir?
A half-empty can of Ginger Ale? I can't believe the audacity of you
young punk kids going joyriding in multi-million dollar *Tribes 2*
bombers while hopped up on *non-caffeinated* sodas. Don't you know that
those slow your reaction time and make you a poor driver?

You're what we on the force call an LBP. Lower Body Part. In layman's
terms, YOU'RE AN ASS. Here's your ticket, and here's some extra ammo for
a spinfusor. You'll need it to get back to your base on foot.

And don't come back until you've done the Dew!
