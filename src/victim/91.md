  Ideally we place a fridge on the roof, with plastic tubes leading down to my computer
  desk, which I can suck on from time to time to replenish my inner juices.

Look, mom, you need to get bigger trays, and you need to get a more
powerful freezer with a continuous available ice-making capacity. Why?
Because I'm getting SMOKED LIKE A RAINFOREST in Half-Life and I blame it
all on my watered-down lukewarm caffinated beverages.

No way, see, here's how it works. I get home from school, I fire up
GameSpy Arcade, and it starts refreshing servers. I have just enough
time to RUN down here, dodge the dog, rip into the freezer, slam some
Coke and ice into a glass, and get back upstairs before the servers are
done refreshing and I've got to settle into the hard, hard decision of
which one I'm going to own tonight.

When I connect to the server, I have about 10 seconds to enjoy a frosty
sip of my cool, delightful soda treat -- cool to the touch and moist
with fresh condensation. Then, I'm in the game. I'm in the zone, ma. I'm
the charge of the Light Brigade, the guns of Navarone, the Merrimac, the
Monitor, Teddy Roosevelt in Manilla.

I'm flying high, I'm at the top of the list, and then the map changes
and my fragile world falls apart 'cuz I go to grab a refreshing sip of
my fresh cool smooveness and all I get is a mouthfulla warm sugary brown
water. MY LIFE SUCKS, and these cheap-ass trays are crampin' my style
like a bad time of the month. You dig?
