Oh, uh, no thank you sir, I don't need your change. I'm not actually
"homeless," not in the conventional sense of the word. No, see, I
started camping here three and a half years ago in the hopes to be the
first to get my hands on *TeamFortress 2: Brotherhood of Arms*. It's
been a long, hard wait. I've subsisted on munchies from the
Whattapretzel kiosk for so long that I've developed a salty crust all
over my body.

You see, I was totally stoked when Valve announced that they were hiring
the guys who developed the *TeamFortress* mod for *Quake I*, and that
they were going to develop a whole separate game. That was ... wow ...
last millenium. I remember 'cuz when I started waiting, there were a
couple of morons who were lining up outside the multiplex for the
Episode 1 Star Wars movie dressed like Boba Fett. Now both Bobas are
back, waiting for Episode 2. What a couple of losers! I would weep, but
my salt-encrusted body leaks no moisture of any kind.

No, I don't want your pity. I want my TeamFortress. Or news from the
outside world. Is Prodigy's *Smack My Bitch Up* still the number one
single? *Seinfeld* is still on the air, right? What kinds of games are
people playing nowadays? What's that you say? You like *Quake 3?* Did
you say *Quake THREE?*

When did they come out with a SECOND one!?
