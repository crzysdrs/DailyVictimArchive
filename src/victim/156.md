Okay, time to open my last birthday gift. Hey, wow, look. *Another* copy
of Deus Ex, which, I might point out, probably also came from the Best
Buy Value shelf for $9.99 this weekend. How did all of you guys *know*
about that? Could it have been because I emailed all of you last week
and told you, *after* I bought a copy for myself?

That's amazing. One dozen copies of Deus Ex. You guys are incredible.
Didn't even *one* of you think to check with the others? Or *me?*

Yep, 11 shrink-wrapped value copies for $9.99 and a twelfth copy of Deus
Ex from Jerry, who gave me the big box version that he bought for the
full price of $49.95. 12 copies alltogether. What does that tell me
about my friends? That's right: I've got eleven cheapskates and one
total dipshit.
