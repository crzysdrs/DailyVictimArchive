Yeahhh boyyzzz -- dim the lights and check these puppies out. Aw yah.
That's right. I bought these right off the rear-end of some raver on the
Boulevard last night. Blinky, blinky, blinky -- awww hunh.

See, my theory is that, when a game developer "makes it," he goes all
out and shows up at industry parties with battery-operated pants. Now,
truthfully, I haven't "made it" yet. So far I've made four and a half
levels for *Unreal Trounament*, not including that one that I made
that's textured entirely with a picture of Kevin's head. Or, uh, I guess
you shouldn't count the one that's just a big lava doughnut.

But hang with me here. What I'm saying is, by purchasing the
battery-operated pants in advance, I'm already *there*. I look the part.
When I go in for a job interview, blinking like a Christmas Tree,
brighter than a disco, louder than a video arcade, they're gonna say,
"WHOA! This guy's all pro."

Then I proceed to sit myself down and to their awe and astonishment I
bust out the goods -- my best level to date. LAVA DOUGHNUT II: The
Apocalpyse.

Whoa dude, I'm dimming. Could you plug me in?
