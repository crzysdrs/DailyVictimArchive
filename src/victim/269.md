  Yeah, another thing — give my dad ten minutes with a drill, he can install a ball-bearing
  axle on this sucker. That's intense.

Yeah, this thing is what, off the shelf? Yeah man, you should crank this
baby up. These Duncans are totally open on the top end, you know? We
need to head to the outlet store and get you a lighter cotton fiber
string — better resilency, better bounceback. I got one of those on my
butterfly — sheeet. You could spend ten times that much at Kay Bee and
not get that kinda performance outta a yoyo.

You should sand your centerpost, help you get a wicked spin. You'd walk
a mean dog with an upgrade like that. This, this here, this is sluggish,
but this yoyo has a lot of potential. I knew this guy over at Crestview
Elementary? Cranked up his Custom aluminum Axlerator way past spec and
was able to go around the world eight times. But he was pretty hardcore,
I mean, you just want to rock the cradle and stuff, maybe get some extra
sleep time ... you should just tweak out this baby here.

I wonder if Duncan released a patch for this model yet?
