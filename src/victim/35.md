  Hah! Look at that voting. I knew you jacklips were a bunch of slackers. This turnout
  is pathetic. Someday, when I'm appointed Director, I'm going to re-institute a policy
  of lashings. I can't wait!

Listen up, fartwhiffers!

This morning the counter on the front of our webpage gave me an error
message instead of correctly identifying how many players were accessing
our massively multiplayer online roleplaying game.

According to our marketing department -- and keep in mind that those
f'ers have *degrees* -- people coming to our website must always see how
many people are logged on and playing the game. You know why? Because we
are massive! and multiplayer! And Online! And a server error on our
webpage communicates none of these!

As the new support head, i'mma gonna clean up this here department. That
means we're gonna lay down a few laws.

First off, I want everyone in here at 9:00 AM. I have a punch clock
installed. And don't attempt to stay and work late, because it turns off
at 5:30 and if you aren't punched out by then, it'll send me a personal
memo identifying you as a SLAPASS.

Secondly, every time our statistics server goes down, I'm going to take
my letter opener and randomly slice off one of your ears. Don't ask me
whose, it's gonna be one of those spur of the moment things. That's just
how it's gonna be: Either we have 100% uptime on our statistics server,
or I will be managing a department of facially mutillated freaks while
wearing a necklace of withered human hearing appendages.

Get back to work!
