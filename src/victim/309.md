Step back! When I push the "Load" button, this screen will fill with the
most egregiously difficult scenario ever to be placed in a digital
medium. You thought my *StarCraft* scenario, "Mile-Wide Mass of Zergs,"
was tough? Wait til you get a load of this baby, a little *Empire Earth*
piece of history that I call "Spain Bends You Over the Rock of
Gibraltar."

That's right. Using this editor, I can lay out a carpet of units like
rolling paint on a wall. I've also taken some liberty with history, you
know, for game balance — which is why Phillip II of Spain has *lasers.*
Forget Carl from downstairs or even his "Wax you in the Industrial Age"
roommate — *nobody* can defeat this scenario.

That's right! NOBODY! I even put a disclaimer on the intro screen:
"WARNING! This scenario is guaranteed to reduce you to a shrieking mass
of withered humanity." On the hints screen, it says "Give up." This
scenario has it all. Voice samples wailing lamentations as you're
defeated! Camera angles that swing around to show your ignominious
defeat from all angles! Even an intro movie wherein a period-priest
reads you your last rights. Oh yah. You heard me. Not even the *almighty
himself* has any hope of victory!

![](/img/victimpics/mar02/god.png)**THIS SHIT'S WAY TOO EASY**  
 When I first saw the Spanish Armada bearing down on my coast, I was
like ... OH ... MY ... SELF. But then I wrecked it with the quickness
and the flavah, Old Testament style. Like Ecclesiastes said, your life's
work is both paltry and meaningless.  
 &nbsp; Oh, and now you have cancer.
