  Wha? Who's making all that banging down there? Why doesn't he just send help? The
  louder I shout the louder that freak hums. I just shouted for him to get me some
  food and he walked into the kitchen like a robot and made himself a sandwich.

  Has Backfired

Well, as you no-doubt heard from this afternoon's
[fiasco](@/victim/123.md), Crenshaw had to go to the hospital 'cuz I
accidentally fired a pencil through his hand with my careful
manipulation of the office air conditioning system.

On the upside, I won the daily InstaGib game. On the downside, I thought
that law enforcement might get involved, so to cover my tracks I crawled
back up into the air vents to remove any trace of my ingenious
hamster-tubing.

Unfortunately, I seem to have wedged myself in a narrow duct here, and I
can't seem to back out. I'm not claustrophobic, but, the air conditioner
is still running and I'm FREEZING in here!

I don't see any way out of this one — someone's going to have to come
in and rescue me. I might as well holler for help.

"HAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLPPPP!!!"

For crying out loud, why doesn't someone answer? My voice has got to be
carrying all over the building — I can hear it reverberating through
the ducts.

"HAAAAALLLLLPPPP!!" Is anyone there? Where the hell are the night shift
tech support guys?

"HEEEEEAAAALLLPPP!!!"

BLISSFUL SILENCE THE CREEPY VOICES IN MY HEAD HAVE RETURNED**  
 I can hear them echoing around the walls despite the pills I've been
taking maybe I should cut back on the coffee I've had three or four pots
this evening but then again that's no more than normal I think maybe
some Cola will help me ignore them or perhaps some more banging on the
walls GO AWAY VOICES! Stop making me do things I will paint my windows
black and hum until the noises stop.
