  Can you give me a hand? I underestimated how big this carpeting was going to be.

Step aside, step aside. I'm in the middle of my workout.

My undisputed reign as the king of the gankers here at this company is
under a withering assault from the likes of Jerry over in tech. Doesn't
he know? I AM THE KING OF GANK!

I knew something was up when we got those new computers in the
conference room. That evening I pulled up a chair, whipped out my
electric screwdriver, and proceeded to "upgrade" my work PC by swapping
out my Voodoo 2 card with that phat GeForce 2 from the conference room.
And lo! What do I find? Inside the conference room PC I discover a Riva
128 card! Someone had beaten me to the punch. I had been both pre-ganked
and *out* ganked!

Right there and then I declared: this was war. Yesterday morning I hit
up the supply cabinet and ganked six boxes of rulers and every red pen
we had. By lunch I had myself two new keyboards and a copy of Photoshop.

You know how all the white board markers disappeared? I wish I could say
that was me, but no -- that was my nemisis, in a spectacularly
high-profile gank. But I will not be outganked! I'm mustering up my
strength, friend. I'm going big.

I've already taken all of the toilet paper from the bathrooms and
tonight I'm loading the conference room table into my truck.
