[![](/img/victimpics/colorappliances.png)](@/victim/34.md)**I CAN HELP
YOU OVERCLOCK THAT TURKEY**  
 You ignorant fools, you're basting a default OEM turkey. Just give me
half an hour with that thing and I can give you twice the white meat and
an over 33% increase in juiciness. Also, I can rig up your carving knife
to slice through human limbs as if through butter.

[![](/img/victimpics/coloracjob.png)](@/victim/41.md)**I AM THANKFUL
FOR MANY THINGS, PARTICULARLY MY ASHERON'S CALL LEVEL 39 WAR MAGE**  
 That's right, I'd like to start off this meal with a little humble
thanks. Thank you for the Mattekar that I killed to get to level 39.
Thank you for my girlfriend, even though she won't let me get anywhere
near the turkey. And most importantly, thank you for Steve's mom.

[![](/img/victimpics/colormymom.png)](@/victim/42.md)**SHUT UP ABOUT
MY MOMMA ALREADY!**  
 I bet it was *you* who logged onto the Tribes server last night under
the nickname "NakedMen" and told everyone my mom got me onto the Tribes
2 beta testing team by going down on their entire QA department. That's
totally untrue! I got on the beta test all by myself by uh ... <span

[![](/img/victimpics/colorflagdefender.png)](@/victim/38.md)**I'VE
BEEN DEFENDING THIS TURKEY SINCE THE START OF MACY'S THANKSGIVING DAY
PARADE**  
 That's right, a few of you have managed to snag a bite of it, but none
of you have so much as come NEAR getting inside, much less escaped with
any stuffing. C'mon, try me. I have a carving knife. You want some? You
want some?

[![](/img/victimpics/colorwoeisp.png)](@/victim/52.md)**I AM NOT
THANKFUL FOR MY LOUSY PING**  
 Let us say that this ear of corn on the cobb represents the eternal
bliss that is multiplayer entertainment, and yay, verily we are but each
one kernel of corn on the cobb, where together we are whole. Now, let us
say that this particular kernal is me. Note that it is not on the cobb.
Instead, note that I am putting it on the plate and smothering it with a
slab of canned cranberry crap. This represents my ISP. Do you see, my
childen? Do you see my private pain? Watch what I do to my ISP with this
dinner fork...

[![](/img/victimpics/colorjolt.png)](@/victim/46.md)**THOSE GIANT
ANIMALS ARE ATTACKING NEW YORK CITY WHILE THE CAST OF THE TODAY SHOW
REMAINS BLISSFULLY IGNORANT!**  
 Good God I knew I shouldn't have stayed up all night playing Deus Ex
and scarfing up Vivarin like popcorn at a movie because now I'm watching
TV and there is this giant puffy Garfield hovering in the air attacking
New York City while a band plays and my hands are shaking too hard to
dial 911 and besides they never listen to me after that time I told them
the Cyberdemon from DOOM was in my house I need another Mountain Dew to
calm down.

**The Daily Victim will victimize again on Monday November 27th. Happy
Thanksgiving!**
