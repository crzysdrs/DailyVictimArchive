blurb: >
  Those bleeps and bloops as your bonus points rack up? Those are the wailings of
  the little tiny blocky widows, whose pixelly stick figure men will never be coming
  home again.

What are you doing? Don't run around the grey rectangle! The mouth blobs
are there! Turn away, turn away! The little men need a blue dot before
the timer runs out, and I'll be damned if I watch you throw their
pixellated little lives away!

Now turn! Go up, up! Your zapper is a precision weapon -- it can only
fire at precise 45-degree angles, so aim it well. Hit the mouth blob!
Well, now you've done it. Can't you hear the men beeping? They're dying,
and it's all your fault.

But the men beside the yellow triangle -- there's still hope for them!
Go quickly! Push up on your joystick as hard as you can! No, NO! Don't
turn away to take a sip of your Diet Coke! You're not just leaving them
to die, are you? You SICK bastard, they're dying up there and you're
moving to the exit to go to the next level with bonus time remaining.
Dying! Dying for want of a blue dot that it was WITHIN YOUR POWER TO
GIVE. You cruel bitch. I hope the end boss eats you alive with ... his
... whatever he does with those things that look like blocky arms or
whatever they are.
