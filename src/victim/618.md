Oh no no *no*, ha ha, that just won't do. See, here at Maurice's Shuttle
Stop and Wookie Wash, we've got a *very* strict policy regarding our
clientele bringing their pet insects inside. Specifically insects of
that size. Meaning ... "gigantic." Particularly big enough to eat ...
me.

No no sir! I don't doubt that this insect is *well* trained, and I
didn't mean to cast doubt with regards to your abilities. Despite being
larger than a truck it is enormously well behaved, though I hesitate to
mention that there IS a ragged half of a Jawa robe hanging from its
slavering maw. Haha, again, I just wanted to gently remind you of our
"no enormous insect" policy and ask that you tie it up outside. With a
large, HEAVY chain, if possible, thanks.

Well, you understand, I'm one of the first player-built cantinas on this
planet. This is a place for characters to relax. To
["chill,"](@/victim/384.md) if you will, what have you. Creating an
environment that is both inviting and safe is a large part of this
establishment's appeal. Now, if someone were to see your *large* insect,
they may -- presuming they do not first wet themselves -- infer the
presence of *smaller* insects, perhaps in the kitchen. And sir, I'm
certain you understand how that would detract from what we'll call the
"ambiance." Hm?

No, You're keeping the bug? Yes yes, very well. You leave me no choice
but to /tell the Wookies. Gentlemen? Please escort the animal trainer
here out back and kick him in the nuts until his nose bleeds. Thank you!
