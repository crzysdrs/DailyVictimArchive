  Working as a freelance pr355 n1nj4 is hard. Many of the sites I work for don't even
  know they hired me until it is too late.

  That...

Just call me Alexi Federov -- PR355 N1NJ4. The Microsoft "GameStock
2001" event is happening here in the crisp March air of Seattle, and the
bulletin in the hotel makes the bold statement that "Absolutely No
Photographic Equipment Will Be Permitted." Bah! They can ASK us to not
bring photographic equipment, but they cannot hope to curtail the
digital photography skills of a trained PR355 N1Nj4.

Hum with me now the pr355 n1nj4 theme music as I slip toward the
exposition center wedged stealthily underneath the courtesy shuttle from
the hotel. Now, as it backs up into the shadows of the loading dock
before returning to the road, I'll simply drop quietly to the pavement
and roll under the quiet darkness of a nearby dumpster. Slowly, slowly,
I'll creep toward the back door. Ah, I see there is a security guard at
this entrance! That fewl, not even wearing body armor or protection
against garot wire. Problem solved.

I'm inside now. Cool flourescent lights illuminate the main entrance --
sheer folly, they'd no doubt ask if I was carrying a camera. But see
here, an entrance labelled "staff only." Fewls! Without card key or
surveilance systems, any door labelled "staff only" may as well read
"staff and pr355 n1nj4s enter here." Silently I sneak through the dimly
lit corridors leading up to the audio-visual brain center of the event.
Wait! Someone's coming! Will it be the potent tranquilizer darts or the
shuriken? No, no, he doesn't see me in the shadow of the drinking
fountain -- he may yet live. I'm on a deadline, after all.

Quietly I scramble over the scaffolding. Below me they're confiscating
cameras and inspecting press badges -- badges? I don't need no steeking
badges. My fansite absolutely positively has to be the first to know
what brand of tires the jeeps in the Xbox version of Halo are using, and
I'll be damned if some lousy press etiquette is going to stand in my
way!

I'll cut a long story short. Casualties were kept to a minimum: six
dead, three wounded, twelve unconscious, and one guy taped to a rafter
that will probably suffer naught but psychological scars. The fruit of
my effort? One fully loaded Sony memory stick containing exclusive
photographs of Brian Reynolds double-dipping a ruffles potato chip and
game developer Chris Taylor making what appeared to be a dick joke. My
work here is done. I escaped out the air vent.
