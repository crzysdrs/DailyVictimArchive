No way, she dumped you? Man, that's a total shocker. She seemed
*perfect* for you. You guys were like the *perfect* couple. At least,
from what I could gather, you know, from what I heard in Internet chat.

She seemed really into you, man. At least, that's what she said that one
time three months ago when she sat down at your ICQ account and sent me
a couple messages. She totally seemed cool. You know, judging by the
emoticons she used.

I can't believe you guys are through! It just doesn't make sense. You
remember that one time, when I called you long distance on the phone to
set up our clan match, and I could sorta hear her in the background?
Yeah, you guys seemed AWESOME together.

And you guys made a cute couple, too! Not that I know what you look
like. But your *Asheron's Call* characters looked cute together, before
she stopped playing.

And she dumped you, hunh? That just blows my mind, man. I never saw it
coming.
