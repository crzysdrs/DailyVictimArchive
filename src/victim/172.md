  I tried to vote "8" for myself, but ended up voting the spread from 6 to 10. Perhaps
  you don't understand what I'm saying ... but then again, perhaps you are physically
  capable of picking your nose.

What is it with computers these days? Every day they're getting smaller
and skinnier. I can't even properly hold a cell phone at this point, I
don't need my computers getting smaller. Perhaps you don't understand
what I'm saying ... but then again, perhaps you haven't found it
neccessary to use a pair of friggin' CHOPSTICKS in order to insert your
friggin' 3D card.

Damn my fat fat fingers!

I've tried many, many keyboards. Those 'ergonomic' keyboards are great,
provided that you are -- say -- a wispy bolemic heroin chick. Me? I'm
what they call ... "big knuckled." No, I take that back. Let's just call
it what it is. I'm a fat, fat fingered man. I type 6 words a minute.
Perhaps you don't understand what I'm saying ... but then again, perhaps
you haven't tried to hit the "T" key within a game to talk, and you
ended up switching to the grenade launcher with the 6 key, priming a
grenade with the G key, spraypainting your logo on the wall with the F
key, then executing your rocket-jump alias with the R key all at the
same time, causing you to instantly burst into a shower of gibs when all
you really intended to do was type out a smiley face.

DAMN MY FAT FAT FINGERS!
