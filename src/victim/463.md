It’s certainly true that your Priestess of the Moon fought hard during
the climactic confrontation by the gold mines in the center of the map.
She was a wildcat, that one. I will give you this: I nearly lost my
Lich. She was downing my undead left and right. You have my utmost
respect! It took my entire compliment of Frost Wyrms and -- what’s that?
Wait, the World’s Smallest Violin wishes to speak.

What’s that you say, tiny, tiny little violin? My, that’s a sad, sad
song you’re playing with your itty-bitty little strings.

Anyways, what was I saying, with regards to your crushing defeat? Oh
yes, I’m sure she gave it her all knowing that if I gained control of
those gold mines it would only be a matter of time before my hideous
Meatwagons and Abominations rolled their hateful fury into the depths of
your once-beautiful glade. Hold on a minute? What was that? I couldn’t
hear you over the sound of The World’s Smallest Violin, as it continues
to play a teeny tiny dirge for your dead Priestess who was unable to
stop the onslaught.

Oh, you tiny tiny violin! How your mournful and incredibly petite little
sounds bring an itty-bitty tear to my eye. Thank you, wee violin, for
putting it all into perspective for us both.
