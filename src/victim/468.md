Yeah yeah, our new kitten is cute and fluffy. Yeah yeah, everyone coo at
his tiny little paws and big soft eyes, woo woo. Lemme tell you
something about that little beast: he’s all quiet and sweet *now*, but
the moment I fire up some *Unreal Tournament 2003* he starts howling
like a tiny banshee.

Look, now he’s acting innocent and playing with my shoelaces. I’m not
fooled, little kitten! The thing is, once I start playing the game, I’m
not sure if he’s terrified by the noise of the rocket launchers and that
goofy announcer ... or if he’s mocking my skillz.

You heard me, mocking! Like somehow my flag defense isn’t good enough
for his feline sensitivity. He howls and howls ... derisively, if you
ask me! Okay, fine *CAT*. C’mere. Let’s see how well YOU defend the
base!

See? See that? Look at him -- he’s using the *keyboard*. Ha ha! You
can’t defend the flag for CRAP, you little rodent! Now people are
shooting you with rocket launchers! HA HA.

Don’t look at me like that.

Look, the kitten started it.

got a kitten. And lacks skillz.\]
