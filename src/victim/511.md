  Now then, let's turn our attention to Santos's landing craft. The one that's wedged
  in between two bridge supports, several feet above the sea...

What’s this, Brainard? You’ve done it again. This time, not only have
your run our *Battlefield: 1942* aircraft carrier AGROUND, you’ve done
so in such a way that the deck is sloped toward the mainland at a nearly
30 degree angle.

Anyone foolish enough to actually get in one of our planes immediately
slides off into the ocean before they can gain enough speed to get
airborne. Not that planes last long anyway. Because the deck is sloped
TOWARDS the land, the enemy can simply shoot the planes with their shore
cannons as soon as they spawn.

Moreover, for the first time in the history of naval warfare, it’s now
possible to be killed by a tank while standing on the deck.

For the record, Naval flogging aboard US vessels was officially banned
by act of the 1851 naval appropriations bill. And you, Brainard, are the
sad result. But I’m not going to let some musty piece of parchment
dating from before the Civil War stand in the way of victory in the
Pacific. So put down your mouse, bite down on this piece of bamboo, and
hand me the cat-o’-nine tails.
