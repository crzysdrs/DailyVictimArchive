I think we're through, Brian! I want a love that's going to last, and
you only love me because of my Godlike Unreal Tournament skills. And my
chest.

Seriously. You don't care about [my career](@/victim/88.md). You
never ask me how my day was. It's falling into a familiar old routine,
Brian, and I've seen it before. You come home and right away you want to
jump into the server with me. I swear unless I'm scoring ultra-kills for
you, you don't care about me. All you care about is my ability to pilot
a redeemer through tight corridors, and my buns.

Well listen up! We're through unless we take a break to get some
culture. We're gonna go out to dinner and we're going to talk about what
you like about art. Then I want to tell you why I think live music is
always better than studio music. We're going to pay for extremely
overpriced coffee in a book store. We will talk about what a knob Freud
is. We will talk about Marx. We will talk about faster-than-light
travel, and possibly why Star Trek 2 was the best of the series. We will
not talk about: glancing the ripper, how soon to start pre-loading the
rocket launcher, which assault map is best, or the taut firmness of my
thighs.

Deal?
