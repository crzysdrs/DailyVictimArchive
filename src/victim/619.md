Hi, my name's Staff Sergeant Butkis, and *I just can't stop killing
Rebel Scum*.

I try! Oh, believe me, I try! I want to work on my scouting skills, so I
can built larger campgrounds capable of healing and supporting my fellow
imperial units in *Star Wars Galaxies.* I'd like to run a few animal
hunting missions, you know, to get my bank account up so I can buy
better weapons.

But no sooner do I walk up to the shuttle stop than I see 'em, my homies
from the Empire. All snazzed up in those uniforms. Some of 'em have
Stormtroopers following them. And they're like, "Hey hey, my brother,
what are you up to?" And I'll mumble sheepishly, "I'm going to go run a
few messenger missions..."

And they'll say, "Really? We're going to hunt rebel scum." I'll start
shaking! I mean, physically shaking! And I'll reply, "OMG GROUP ME D00D"
and then I'm *in*.

We're all a bunch of rebelscumassassinaholics! I just can't stop killing
rebels! I can't do it, man.

\[Breaks down sobbing, and then pauses to pull out a blaster and shoot
some rebel pilot running to the cantina.\]
