  Maybe we can all go after her, and if one of us gets a phone number, we all get

I mean, look at her! 5'10", long natural red hair, curves on either side
of her waist -- you don't stand a chance. She'd con yellow for you.

You know, con. Like in *EverQuest* or *Galaxies*, when you use the
/consider command, or look at the little icons above people's heads. Yah
yah, I know this is real life and all, but that's what I'm saying. If
you *could* con people in real life, she'd have a big ol' yellow icon
above her head. It would say "suicidal" in your chat window. That's all
I'm saying.

*TALK* to her? Dude, listen to reason, man! She's not conning white, I
can tell you that. Even if you had bothered to shower this morning,
she'd still be conning yellow. Why not go over and talk to the chick in
the sweatshirt who got hit by the acne stick? She's conning blue. At
least to me. In fact, I think I'm going to go for it.

Steve, talk some sense into this guy. His ego is gonna get massacred.
We'd have to do a corpse retrieval or something. What's that? Have Steve
break the ice? I mean, sure, she'd con white to Steve but he's got a
girlfriend already. That's like a class restriction or something.

C'mon, I'm just trying to be realistic here, that's all.
