  I saw Kip tear open the envelope this morning, and boy, he sure seemed excited!
  He went stright to his room and sharpened his machette, I'm assuming in anticipation
  of opening his exciting new presents.

Why yes, look at this spam mail I've gotten honey. Isn't that exciting?
NO! -- not the one about 500% more sperm. That would qualify me as a
lethal weapon. No no, this service called "Letters from Santa." See, you
type in the text you want, and they'll send our child an actual printed
letter with an authentic North Pole postmark. How clever! Let's compose
something right now, shall we?

*"Dear Kip, you've been an especially good boy this year, unlike last
year when you [started a riot at the local mall](@/victim/311.md).
Santa likes good boys!*

*Because Santa likes you very much, and because it's astonishingly cheap
nowadays, you're going to get a shiny new GameCube. Also, you can have
either Kirby's Air Ride or Disney's Skate Adventure -- just let your
parents know what you want! Ho ho ho! I'm really Santa, for real.*

*Love, <s>Mom and Dad</s> Santa."*

Oh that's rich! Our little angel will be extremely pleased.

MAN:  
 YOU BEST BE STEPPIN' OFF THE KIRBY, FOO.**  
 Listen up holmes, here's how its gonna go down. I don't know what you
been smokin' when you wrote me that last letter, but my Christmas list
don't include no Kirby. When I saw you at the mall I tol' you to hook me
up with *True Crime: Streets of LA* and the *Grand Theft Auto
Double-Pack*. What's this noise about Disney Skate? Dog. Don't make me
come up there. You'll find a reindeer head in your bed. I'll find a sled
and do me up a drive-by, come New Years if I'm sittin' on Kirby. If you
and me want to keep it real, you best be forkin' over the M-rated merch
'cuz I can't be buyin' it at the store. Word is bond. -Kip
