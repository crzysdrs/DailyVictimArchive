Attention webmaster;

I was immensely pleased to partake in your [History of
MUDs](http://web.archive.org/web/20010112000000/http://gamespy.com/articles/january01/muds1/)
article. Your thoughtful, penetrating discussion of the medium left
little to be desired. However, you failed to mention the primary reason
that I and others like me enjoy this verbose, social form of gaming;
there are simply few other venues online in which to have intercourse
with animals.

Take, for instance, your Baldur's gate. A wonderful online experience,
if you enjoy witty banter and slaughtering nefarious otherworldly
creatures alongside your friends. But, should you wish to procreate with
the wildlife? Zero options. Please, try for yourself.

On the other hand, try logging into
[FurryMUCK](http://web.archive.org/web/20010112000000/http://www.furry.org/)
sometime. Sure, you might find intelligent people engaging in
conversations about politics or swapping about witty diatribes, but they
can easily be avoided. Look for some hot tubs. Within fifteen minutes I
partook of a monkey, two gerbils, and a peacock.

One time I met a hamster who wanted to be used *as* a sex toy.

Thank you for your wonderful service to the gaming community. Myself?
I'm off to catch some tail, as it were. Here here.
