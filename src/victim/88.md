  Okay, okay, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be so harsh. But, cheer up, if I *was* from
  outer space and was trying to mate with the human race for the survival of my purple-haired
  anime species, you'd be near the top of my list. 'strue.

Hello there, thanks for writing. I'm glad you like my website design.
The answer, unfortunately, is no -- I won't be your girlfriend.

Also, while I may in fact *look* like an anime goddess, I do not own a
missile launcher, nor can I fly. I wear these metal things in my hair
because they look cool, especially online. Same with the purple eye
makeup.

I did not come from outer space to mate with you.

My hair isn't naturally purple; I dyed it that way. I'm afraid I didn't
know it was your lifelong dream when I did it; I thought it would make
some great digital pics. Speaking of which, I do not operate a 24-hour
webcam. I just design websites. Sorry!
