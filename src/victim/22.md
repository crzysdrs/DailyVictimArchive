I was enthusiastic about becoming a vegetarian. My understanding was
that certain foods, such as corn and lima beans, could be mixed together
to form complete sets of protein -- valuable proteins that would enable
me to keep running my Unreal Tournament fan site without the frequent
nausea and unconsciousness that accompanied my efforts to cease eating
alltogether.

The first day without meat was fine. I had a craving for a hot dog
shortly after lunch, but I ate some yougurt and then licked the aluminum
foil lid until the cravings passed some thirty minutes later. Dinner
consisted of what vegetarians call "quiche," which is pronounced
"quiche." It's like a pie, but there's no meat, not even the obvious
choice of bacon -- which seemed very strange to me.

By the third day the traffic on my Unreal Tournament fan site was up. I
think this is because, possibly while I was feeling faint in the late
morning, I replaced my webpage background pattern with a brilliantly
tiled .gif image of raw, tasty ground beef.

The sixth day was almost my worst. I had taken some tofu and mashed and
kneeded it until it was roughly the shape of a turkey leg. Then I
inserted a curling iron into it, to pretend it was a bone. I forgot it
was on. Tasty, though. Worth the pain. I had seconds.

The seventh day I blacked out.

My eighth day as a vegetarian was my last. I awoke covered in foam that
seemed to be eminating from my mouth. I crawled to a soup kitchen and
stole a barbecue fork from a man wrapped in a garbage bag. As if in a
dream I watched myself standing on a table threatening passers-by.
"Meat!" I shouted. "Meat! Meat! Meat! Meat! ... Meat! Meat! Meat! MEAT!
... Meat!" A woman in white was serving soup. It was potato soup. They
had no meat that day. I had a fork.

The woman in white was delicious.
