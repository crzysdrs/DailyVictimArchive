  Oh dear... I seem to have sent my sacrifice saved game to the SETI people ... Maybe
  they won't interpret the data correctly. Could be a bit of a mess.

Hello, subcreature. What's that you've got in there? GeForce 2? Oh no --
a TNT 2? Good God, it is like the pitious cunieform scribblings of a
prepubescent society clinging desperately to solid land lest they slip
haplessly back into the goo from whence they evolved. Oh, sorry, don't
take that personally.

See, I myself have recently installed a GeForce 3. Not available yet,
you say? You just don't know [the right people](@/victim/75.md) at
nVidia. Of course, what I have is actually a pre-production alpha unit
that's two foot long and must be cooled by suspending it above a
styrofoam vat of liquid nitrogen, but the loss of a finger here or there
is a small price to pay for progress.

FACT: I can run the
[SETI@Home](https://web.archive.org/web/20010403000000/http://www.seti.org/science/setiathome.html)
project AND Shiny's
*[Sacrifice](https://web.archive.org/web/20010403000000/http://www.strategyplanet.com/sacrifice/)*
at the same time! For reasons self-explanatory, of course. SETI@Home
allows me to continue mankind's search for extraterrestrial intelligence
at rates heretofore impossible even with a supercomputer, while at the
same time Sacrifice's graphics are so white hot they're actually
*widening my scrotal arteries*.

Sorry to trouble you, I was just here to see if you had a motherboard
capable of mounting a Pentium 5.
