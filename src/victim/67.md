title: Many Would Be Stunned or Horrified by the Sight of My "Tribes Hand," but I've
  Started to Grow Quite Fond of It

Well, I've got a Tribes hand. Tribes Hand, rather, with a captital "H."
As far as I know, it's the only one. I've grown sort of fond of it. I
don't even let myself wank with it. Because it rules.

History of the Hand: I get a job at this nice little ISP called
Laker.net. One prerequisite besides all of that mumbo-jumbo about
knowing your stuff was being able to play Tribes. I'm serious. They had
Tribes hour; 5-6 was a paid hour of Tribes, every day. Addiction incurs.

I leave the job, I move to college, I still play. I fiend. I see my
super elite HUD mod when I'm awake, I see those poor Scouts crumbling
from my rail in my sleep. I doodle the Starwolf logo during class.

Well, that was then. And now there's now, where I'm too busy to care
(thanks a lot, education), but I've still got the biggest thing to come
from Tribesing-- the Hand. That's right, I've got THE HAND. So basically
if you look at my right hand, on the part where one would receive a
karate chop or some such blow, it's about three times wider than my
left. And I'm left handed, so it didn't grow from the lovin'. It's 100%
pure Tribes-developed muscle.

And I bet I could crush stuff, too, if I hadn't been trained to exercise
complete control through sniping. Oh yeah.

You get the picture. I'd scan it for you if you like, but I'd feel
dirty.
