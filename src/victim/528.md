  Yeah, you know, it's legal to do that here in California. Well, provided you have
  all the permits. But that's what the Pope is for.

Gentlemen, gentlemen. We’ve been cooped up in this room for nearly ten
hours now. I agree that we’ve got to take aggressive steps to succeed in
this business, but the feeling I’m getting from all of you is a lack of
commitment. No, I mean, TOTAL commitment.

A business model I’d like to propose instead is based off of my
experiences with *Medieval: Total War*. First, we begin aggressively
hiring temp workers, hereinafter referred to as “peasants.” Then we get
some high-priced consultants, the guys who show up on weekends in Oxford
shirts. From here on out we’ll refer to them as “Mercenary Armored
Cavalry.”

Anyways, I’d like to suggest in quarter 2 of next year that we send in
our biz guys to buy out our competitor’s media purchasing division. This
is known as “Bribing their weak army with the Diplomat.” Then, we send
our army of peasants into their media purchasing division, fire
everyone, and then we burn everything in sight and sell all of their
expensive ergonomic chairs for a profit. Afterwards we sell off that
whole company. I call this the “raping and pillaging” part of the plan.

Once they’re preoccupied with re-conquering their media services
division, during Q3 we assault their corporate headquarters with archers
and trebuchets...

No no, actual Trebuchets. I’m not using analogies anymore.
