What the hell are you doing, Frank!? Keep your head low! Stick to the
plan!

You don't realize how much trouble we'll get into if we don't pull this
thing off. UCI has strict policies against running game servers on
university lines. If they find ours, we're screwed. Then where will the
clan practice?

I told you before, Stewie already tried remote admin â€” he even got that
[overclocked kid](@/victim/13.md) to try to do it, but the system is
locked up. Only a hard boot will do. That means we gotta get to the
server room undetected, hit the reboot button, and get the hell out of
here before that [idiot tech support dude](@/victim/16.md) realizes
that we snuck an extra machine into their server farm.

So, on my mark, we get on our knees and crawl doubletime over to those
vending machines, then I'll boost you up to the air duct. Hurry up, at
10 PM sharp Stewie will divert security by knocking on the door dressed
as a telephone repairman and you and I will only have a couple of
minutes to slip undetected into the laundry hamper! Ready? GO!
