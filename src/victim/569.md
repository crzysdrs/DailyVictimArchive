Good morning, gentlemen. I remind you that this morning’s meeting is
strictly classified for reasons of national security, so please adhere
to the standard protocols.

Now then, I’ve been asked to demonstrate to you the effectiveness of our
modern computer-trained fighting force. State-of-the-art digital
simulations have turned America’s young men and women into an
unparalleled twenty-first century fighting force. No other nation is as
highly skilled in modern military techniques such as “Grenade Jumping,”
essential skills in the battlefield of tomorrow.

What? Oh yes, I can see that there was some discomfort in the room at
the mention of grenade jumping. It’s a modern art, gentlemen, and it’s
revolutionizing this century’s warfare just as mechanized armor and air
power revolutionized the last. You can rest assured that when the war
starts overseas, our first and foremost wave of attack will be
spearheaded by our crack team of expert grenade-jumpers.

Please, please, settle down. I have the floor. I can see some of you are
not familiar with Grenade Jumping. It’s a precise art, one that was
discovered after hours and hours of computer simulation. And drinking.
See, the soldier pulls the pin of a grenade and tosses it to the ground
in front of him or her. Then, with precision timing born of the desire
to defend freedom around the globe, the soldier runs over the grenade
and presses the jump button as soon as it goes off. The soldier is then
flung, sometimes as high as two hundred yards into the air, well over
and behind the enemy emplacements.

Gentlemen! Gentlemen! I assure you that this works in the simulators. We
do it all the time to kill those camping or sniping bi-atches bunkered
down in fortresses. Using tactics such as these, our team will be able
to capture the enemy flags with ease. Or, capture ... well, whatever it
is we’re capturing in that godforsaken desert.
