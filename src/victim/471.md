C'mon, you have to believe me. I turned the game on, and there I was in
my house, but there was a lump under the sheets. So I pushed them aside
to the sound of rising dramatic music and WHAM! Horse-head!

You know what it is? I think it's that Nook guy, the one who owns the
shop. I owe him money on the house and I think he was trying to drop me
a hint. Either that, or Wart Jr. the frog was getting' heavy on my 'cuz
I still haven't gotten his Game Boy back from Lu Lu the Hippo. The scary
thing is, I mean, it's a HORSE head. It coulda been someone I knew.
Henry the Horsie? Who knows? The guy probably had a job. A nice house. A
dipping bird.

Look, why don't you believe me? I'm telling you, that Raccoon ... he's
got it in for me. He's *after* me. I don't want to go back in there.
Don't make me go back in there!
