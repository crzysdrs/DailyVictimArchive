No, they're not *scary* places. I mean, they're just dull. Here's the
blacksmith. And here's the inn. Oh look, this barn is infested with
rats. Mnnn, the funny old man in the tower makes potions for you.

No, I don't want to buy some ale and hear some rumors. I've heard them
before. All of them. Goblins in the forest outside of town? Spiders in
the forest outside of town? Bandits in the forest outside of town?

Can I ask you a question: *Why'd you build a town in the middle of such
a dangerous forest?*

I've learned a kind of hardcore townclearing strategy, where I book
through there, buy a longsword and some leather armor by talking to as
few people as possible, and then just head into the woods as quickly as
I can run. Or I jump into the nearest sewer grate to bash on some rats.
If I'm not careful, someone runs up to me and wants their daughter
rescued, their lost dog found, or some sort of package delivered.

Ah, so you've got a new RPG, hunh? Does it have a town level? It does?
Towns? I don't do towns.
