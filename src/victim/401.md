Well, here's one for you. This week I get an email from my ISP that says
that I've been using more than my allotted bandwidth. Hmm, I think,
that's funny. There was nothing on my webserver but my two-page website
that has digital pictures of the movie I made with Lego blocks. Did
BlockWars make the big time?

But no, I open up my webserver and sure enough it's been hacked by
pirates. Real Hax0r types. They didn't even bother to hack my Lego
pages, either. No, they used the whole thing as a file transfer sever
for *weeks*. But... here's the deal...

They left behind hundreds of gigs of warez!

That's right, everything from dirty movies to cracked games to leaked
betas to defense department passwords. I mean, this thing is STACKED.
What would *you* do? You know, on the one hand, I don't advocate piracy
of any type. On the other hand, this stuff just ended up on my property
against my will, you know? Still, I couldn't even bring myself to
install the goods.

Instead I just kept the file names but replaced every single game
executable with [*Shareware Leap
Frog*](http://web.archive.org/web/20020627000000/http://www.fileplanet.com/index.asp?file=42399)
from Freakware. Let's just see if those pirates can break my record of
406 points!

Of course, I'm keeping the pr0n.
