Hello friend.

You've no doubt noticed that extra spring in my step between class
periods. Huzzah! My hormones can hardly restrain themselves.

Recall, if you will, the days of 8-bit and 16-bit videogame systems.
Those pixellated blobs on the screen did nothing for me -- I had to make
do with pictures on the front of the manual, or the cheat pages of
Nintendo Power magazine.

By the time Tomb Raider came out, I thought technology had reached its
apex. Small wonder I never got past the first level, with so many
corners to back Lara Croft into!

But have you heard, friend, what those crazy Japanese people are up to
next? The PlayStation 2! It has some kind of "emotion engine" or
something. I don't know what it means, but I saw screenshots of creamy
thighs and all I can say is, "Humdinger!"

I hope to get one as quickly as possible, removing entirely my need for
human contact. Ciao!
