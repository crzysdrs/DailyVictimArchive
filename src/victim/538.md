Wow, I really got to think this through. Today’s the last day of my
school vacation. Come Monday, I’m back in Mrs. Brinkley’s room, trying
not to let her notice I’m doodling mushrooms on the side of my notebook.

By all rights, today’s the day I should be at Geoff’s house, playing
with the copy of *Mario Party 4* he got for Christmas, screaming things
like “crap on a stick” because his mom doesn’t like us to swear in front
of his little sister, even though she plays as the Princess and always
lucks out ‘cuz she’s a baby. And a jerk. But wait, that’s not what we’re
talking about.

What we’re talking about is the fact that it’s almost seventy degrees
out there even though it’s January, probably the nicest weather we’re
gonna have in weeks. To top it off, [Tim and Sarge the
Puppy](@/victim/82.md) found an old mattress out behind those
apartments on Spring Street. He and Brian -- little Brian, not big Brian
-- drug it to his back yard and put his skateboard ramp out in front of
it, and now they’re running up the ramp and then jumping onto the
mattress.

That is *so badass*.

So anyways, what are we gonna do dude? We got *Mario Party* over here,
or jumping on to a mattress from a skateboard ramp. Even [Kip and those
kids who started the Mall riot](@/victim/311.md) are there. And look
at what Tim’s doing -- he’s freestyling onto the mattress. Whoa, did he
just grab his ankles on the way down? That was *Sweet Ass Sweet!*

On the other hand, I could be wailing away at Geoff and his stupid
sister with a big monkey.

Dude it’s decisions like these that define our young lives. You know
what? That first leap onto the mattress, man, that could be my first
step towards a promising career. I got my future to think about, dude.
Yeah ... yeah, that’s right. Hold my shoes, I’m hitting the mattress.
