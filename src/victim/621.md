  I also hacked the Daily Victim script, but only I can see the results. And one time
  I made out with this other guy's mom.

I do, and I like it. And you're bragging about your stupid Radeon 9700!
I got a Radeon ... 9900. And a half. And I crank up the resolution to
16384 and I still get one hundred ... million frames a second. The text
is so small it looks like DOTS. They could fit the Library of Congress
on my *Quake* screen. AND THEY HAVE. Cuz I told them they could.

See 'cuz I went to the Alienware website and custom-configured my
machine, but what I did was I HACKED INTO THEIR HTML code, cuz I know
how, and I changed the "Configure your own PC" page so that I could
order hardware that wasn't supposed to be on the market yet. And I paid
like half as much as you did for your Radiator...thing.

My harddrive has like a terragig, and I just drug and dropped the
Internet onto my C: drive and it's still copying but I'm gonna get the
whole thing.

A porn star's gonna have my baby.

I have a custom case too. It was airbrushed by that guy with the chopped
off ear. He owed me big time cuz I built a water-cooler for his
mother-RAM.
