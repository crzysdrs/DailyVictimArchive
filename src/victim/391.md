Mmaaaa-aan, I'm *ser*ious. This babe in the [Arcade chat
room](https://web.archive.org/web/20020614000000/http://www.gamespyarcade.com/)
is totally on to me. It's my new user icon, AKA EXTREME CHICK MAGNET.
It's like throwing chum in the booty ocean.

No no dude check this honey out. She just private messaged me: "I'm from
Oregon :D :D" You see that dude? DOUBLE D-smileys! Chicks are big on the
smileys, but when they bust out the TWO smileys, they're as good as
undoing your belt.

Okay man, whatever, look through the message history. See that? No,
right there, the winky. Bigtime wink, right after she saw my pic. This
one's HUNGRY. What? No, she wasn't patronizing me, no way man, that was
like a real wink. Look at the double-spaces before she typed the
semicolon -- she's moist, I'm telling you.

Hot damn, new message -- HOSE ME DOWN! Look at that! A colon and a
capital P ... she's showing TONGUE. This babe is ready to party. I'm
gonna show her my home page.
