Soooo ... don't get me wrong, I was pretty excited about the chip, too,
so we could copy all those hacked games and play them on your
Playstation, but uh, I can't install this for you. This chip isn't
compatible. No, not with your PlayStation, no. Not with any Playstation,
really. Yeah, it's uh ... how can I say this? This is a potato chip.
Yeah. Yeah, it's, it's snack food. I'm sorry.

Well, hang on, slow down -- I know what the guy probably *said*, but I
think he was lying to you. ... oh yeah, when he assured you he wasn't
lying? I think he was lying then, too. Well, I'm pretty sure, yeah, cuz,
if you look closely with me here, yeah, you see what I mean? Yeah, yeah.
It's potato. It's greasy. It's ... it's lunch-munchies, man.

.... hmmm. I see. That's, yeah, that's sure a lot of money. How did you
get that much?

... geez. Yeah, that's harsh. Did your mom even know you *had* her old
engagement ring? Can you hock it back? -- oh -- oh, right, right, the
guy has all the money. Hmmm. Yeah. What? Oh no, I don't think you can
trade the chip to the pawn shop to get back your mom's ring again. No
... no, see, it's ... it's a potato chip, not sure what the street value
is, but it's not even in the original wrapper. I just, uh, broke some
crumbs off, too, I'm pretty sure that devalues it. Yeah. Yeah ... sour
cream and onion. Yeah.

Can I uh ... can I eat this? I mean, is that okay? I'm starvin' balls
here. Yeah. Yeah.
