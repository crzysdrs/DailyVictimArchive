Stella, you *never* listen when I tell you how to play the fighting
games, you *never* listen. I tell you you should punch, you go and make
with the kicking. He's down on the ground blocking Stella, what with the
kicking? What is that? What are you trying to do? You trying to give me
a heart attack Stella?

Now, he's going to try to pin you in the corner Stel, hit him with the
back-forward punch. You press back then forward, it's big Stella, it's
huge. It's a big punch. Oy, fine, you don't wanna do a big punch? Is
that what you're saying? Look, look at me, you think I got here by
kicking all day NO! I was a puncher, oh and back in the day, I was a
MEAN one with the double-tapping forward and hitting the punch button,
they never saw it coming. But you? You might as well send him a
telegram, hello! I'm Stlla STOP gonna try to kick low again STOP block
low then throw me into the corner again STOP! Oy vey.

Don't give me that look, watch the game, watch the game. Here he comes
again, make with the blocking and how! OYoyoy, he's OY Stella, he just
tore you down like the old Freemont building. Why with the not blocking,
why Stella? I says "hit the block button" but you haven't blocked since
LBJ was in the white house. Hello, why are you putting the controller
down? You was doin' fine. Oh no, I don't wanna play, I don't get into
these games.
