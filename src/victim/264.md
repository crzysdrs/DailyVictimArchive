Okay dude, cut the *Day of Defeat* out or I'm going to cut it out for
you! BACK OFF! Don't make me run with these! One snip and your DSL line
is history.

You and I both know it's your turn to clean out the fridge. I did it
*last* year. I made the mistake of opening up a triangular piece of foil
and the fumes it emitted left me blind in one eye for weeks. There was
also a tupperware container that I presumed was brown. However, I
discovered that whatever substance that had been inside it had tainted
the container, I can only assume by chemically bonding with the plastic
itself to form a new and unique substance that smelled oddly sour
despite the lid being fused shut many months before.

There was a salad located in a plastic bag. The lettuce had long since
crumpled into a wet brown mush. The mush proceeded to evaporate. The
bag, which then contained a brownish stain, became fused with the
plastic refridgerator tray. When it was finally time to clean it up, I
actually couldn't scrape the remains of the bag offof the tray. It was
as though it had been painted there, or burned into place via some sort
of "Shroud of Turin" phenomena. There was no trace of the Salad, only
whispered rumors that it would someday return to the refridgerator in
what the resident fungus no doubt called "The Second Cleaning."

I mean it, dude! I'm not going back in there! I'm still haunted by the
visions of that veal cutlet that had long since ceased to be veal, or
even a cutlet. It's your turn man. Look, I'm not afraid to use these!
