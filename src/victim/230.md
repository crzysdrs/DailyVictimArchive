Hello, game producers! I have a collection of some 50-odd games from the
last three years and, back in the day, it was easy to keep them neatly
categorized on my color-coded shelving units. But no, you a-holes have
to go and try to screw things up.

Like *Deus Ex.* What do you call that?
First-Person-Shooter-Adeventure-RPG? You guys are dicks. I had to buy
three copies just to get it filed in all the right places.

Leave my genres alone!

I'm a firm believer in absolute segregation. What the crap are they
trying to pull with *WarCraft III*? Get your frickin' RPG out the hell
of my realtime strategy. I don't want orcs who get better at stuff, I
have a shelf over here for people who get better at stuff. THIS shelf if
for clicking on my barracks until I have enough people with guns to
shoot all of the other people with guns. Don't you see the plastic
label?

I almost had an aneurism when I picked up *Black & White*. You pompous
British game developmer freaks are messing up my action. What was this,
strategy? RTS? God-game? Sim-builder? Thank God I had a special shelf
already set aside for "high concept video games that played like crap,"
so far containing only *Battlecruiser 2000.* I dodged a bullet with that
one.

But if one more freak announces that they're going "massively
multiplayer" and "adding RPG elements" to a "classic forumla" I'm gonna
shove a shelf up your collective rumps.
