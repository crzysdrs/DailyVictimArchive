Hi all! It's me, Freddy. Ever since [GameSpy
Arcade](http://web.archive.org/web/20010425000000/http://www.gamespyarcade.com/download)
started offering voice chat in the dedicated chat rooms, neither my
roommate nor I have been without a date for a week.

Of course, we share a single PC microphone, so I've had to extend my
pre-PC-gaming cleansing ritual. Used to be that I would wash and scrub
my hands and trim and clean under my fingernails to keep our mouse and
keyboard squeaky clean. But now I've got to consider *oral* Hygiene as
well! That means brushing, flossing, and mouthwash before I step up to
the mic. I also wash my hair and clean my ears using alcohol and cotton
swabs, in case I should use the headphones.

If only I could convince my roommate to do the same. He has no
pre-PC-use cleansing ritual. Yesterday morning I found him eating a
piece of chocolate cake at the keyboard -- no plate -- no fork!! Just
... eating cake! Then he wiped his mouth WITH HIS MOUSE HAND! I started
screaming and throwing pillows. I pointed to a schmear of chocolate
icing on the mouse button and called him Satan.

Things came to a head yesterday evening. I had just finished waxing my
facial pores and was finally ready for some good ol' Internet chat with
the hotties. I put on the headphones and adjusted the microphone, *and
it smelled like KIELBASA!* I actually passed out.
