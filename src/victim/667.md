  Hey, so long as he doesn't fall on any spikes, the rings won't go flying in all
  directions, right? He's a fast little guy. I'm sure the ring is safe. From the eye
  dude.

Hey guys! What's up? Gandalf -- whoa! You're back! Dig the white duds.
It's very you. I like what you've done. Legolas, very nice -- you got
that elf-eye for the straight guy thing going on and it WORKS. Great to
see you guys aga-

The what? The ring? Oh THAT ring. Yeah, the ring. Cracks of Doom, right
right. That whole deal with the ring. Precious, right. Yah. You guys
want to sit down somewhere? You know, since we're catching up and stuff?

So ... right, about that whole deal with that ring and stuff. I had it
on a little chain in my pocket -- hey, that reminds me of a riddle my
Uncle used to tell: "What have I g-"

Okay, sorry, sorry. I'll tell it later. The ring. So ... about the ring.
I was ... well, me and Sam were ... me and Sam and Gollum I guess ... we
were ... BIG spiders. Uhmm. Well, anyways, we were up on the mountain,
and ... Well, I distinctly remember I was near some sort of
loop-the-loop made out of mossy stone. And then ... WHAMS! Just ...
there was this blue hedgehog. All balled up. REALLY fast. And just ...
WHOOOOOSH! No more ring. One second I had it ... then ... Hedgehog.

Sorry. You know. About the ring.
