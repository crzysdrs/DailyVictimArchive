It's always tricky arranging those international clan matches. In order
to play those guys from the Iceland, we had to burn the midnight oil and
prepare for a 2AM match. And that's the problem. See, here in the
'States we have what's known as "Daylight Saving Time," a device
invented by Benjamin Franklin to torture and confuse people in the event
that the Imperial system of measurement didn't do the trick. Every
Spring you set your clocks forward one hour.

So, after doing the Dew for hour on end to keep ourselves awake, I
announced that the server was ready and we all jumped on. The match
would last until 3:00 AM at which point a script I'd written would
automatically shut down the server and spit out the winner. We all took
up positions in our respective bases and once the teams were all online
the game started. 3...2...1... FIGHT!

I was in the flag room. I started to back toward the rocket launcher.
Meanwhile, Joey rushed forward to take the bridge. I guess one of the
Icelanders had spawned in the sniper room of his base -- he grabbed a
rifle, looked out the window, and pegged Joey seconds after the match
began.

Then the match ended, before Joey's body had even hit the ground. The
score was 1-0. The dudes from Iceland began wooping and celebrating on
the screen in a language we didn't understand, drowning out my effort to
explain what happened.

Afterwards in the chat room we tried to tell them that every Spring the
United States changes all its clocks. They refused to believe a whole
country could be duped into doing something so crazy.
