Hello girls and boys.

I'd like to thank your teacher, Mrs. Henderson, for having me as your
special guest today. Blessed are the children, for they cannot yet aim!

I'm here to describe to you how the "Internet" works â€” I'm sure you've
heard a lot about the Internet! Well, [I am an Internet
expert](@/victim/39.md). You see, only one a week ago I succombed to
a fit of unholy rage and [attacked my Internet Service Provider with a
broadsword.](@/victim/46.md) Those bitches had it coming! (I'm sorry,
don't ever say that aloud.) Fortunately my sentence was waived in favor
of a few dozen hours of community service, some of which I will fulfill
here.

Now then, allow me to draw a picture of what the Internet looks like:

{% css_class(class="right clear") %}
![](/img/graphics/cloud.png) That's right boys and girls, the Internet
looks like a big cloud. And where else do you find clouds? Billy? No,
Billy, coming out of the Teachers' Lounge doesn't count. That's right!
Clouds come from Heaven! The Internet is Heaven. It's a holy, righteous
place, where every day is Easter.
{% end %}

But yay, the path to Heaven is fraught with evil, for the only way to
get there is through an "ISP." And lo, ISP's are terrible places, you
end up getting attacked by this [chick with a desk fan and a
penguin](@/victim/41.md), and the cops say your fingers look like
they got gnawed bloody by a duck.

Anyways, these ISPs are run by Corporate Oligarchists. Can you say that
with me?

{% css_class(class="right clear") %}
![](/img/graphics/corporate.png) For verily they shall say upon you,
"Free Installation!" and "Blazing Speed!" but then you get this bill for
a $250 network modem and LO, behold when you connect to a Counter-Strike
server your ping is higher than your license plate number because you're
too far away from some den of sin they call the "Central Office."
LIARS!! Can you tell me who ELSE lies, boys and girls? That's right!
{% end %}

{% css_class(class="right clear") %}
![](/img/graphics/devil.png) SATAN! Satan lies!
{% end %}

The devil himself doesn't want you to tread the righteous path and
frolick in the Elysium Fields of Heaven! But don't cry, because you can
kick his lying money-grubbing slippery broadband-pimping devil ass.
Here's a pike for you, Jamie, and for you Christie I have this scimitar.
Danny, you lucky little boy, you get the nunchacku!

Uh-oh, I think I see Mrs. Henderson bustling down the hallway with my
parole officer in tow. Billy, can you help me out this window? If they
ask where I went, tell them you can't hear it when the devil speaks!
