No way, stop waving it in front of my face like that dude! I've got a
Chem exam tomorrow. Organic Chem, no less, with professor Hubert -- you
know, the guy who yells "Du Lieber!" in the middle of class and throws
chalk at students? I gotta study all day and then get a good night's
rest. I can't afford to get wrapped up in God's gift to 2001 video
gaming.

No, no, I *don't* want to touch the CD. I know you had to import it from
Japan. I know that it requires a special Japanese edition of the PS2 to
play, yah yah, I got all that. And I agree that it is a rare opportunity
to be among the first Americans to see this incredible demonstration of
the PS2's gaming prowress.

Stop it! Don't even *think* of plugging it in while I'm in the room! I
don't even want to see it. I don't want to even hear it. I don't want to
look at the rain effects. Stop it! Turn that off! I mean it, I gotta get
a B or better on this exam or Hubert's gonna put the hurt on my GPA so
hard that my parents are gonna ... mnnnn look at that. Look at how they
rendered those headlights. Check out the rain. Ohmigod, he's bungie
jumping onto the deck of a moving ship wearing Thermoptic camo!

Step aside and hand me the controller or I will rip it violently from
your cold bleeding hands.
