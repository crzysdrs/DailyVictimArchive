  I'm glad you guys confessed. I'm not sure I could bring myself to killing Hambo.
  Not even after he made fun of my shirt the other day. \[Holds back a sniffle\]

SIT! I want everyone in the same room for this. Look, we’ve shared this
apartment for nearly two years. And so, when it was time to play my new
copy of *Animal Crossing* on the GameCube, I thought, sure, we could all
share that, too. Like civilized giant-headed cartoon people.

You know what I want? I want to know that I can work all day at the
pizza place, and I can return home — still freshly coated in grease —
and sit down for some nice relaxing *Animal Crossing*, secure in the
knowledge that the coconut trees I planted yesterday afternoon will NOT
have been molested the night before just because *SOMEBODY* discovered
how much fun it is to use the axe.

And YES, I’m looking at YOU GUYS, because I know damn well that Wendell
the Wandering Walrus doesn’t walk around packin’ hatchets. What? Don’t
try to paw this off on Mitzi the cat. You’re only making it harder on
yourselves. Well? Any confessions you’d like to make? No?

Okay, so nobody’s fessing up. Fine. I’ll tell you how it’s going to go
down. Starting at EIGHT PM TONIGHT, I’m going to log in there and,
beginning with Nook’s department store, the HATCHET DECAPITATIONS will
begin until one of you fesses up. Oh yah. The Raccoon is gonna be the
first to go. Then I’m taking out THE FROG. You hear me Tom? The frog is
goin’ down by 8:10. By 8:20 I’ll have tracked down Hank the Parrot, and
there’s gonna be nothing left but FEATHERS hanging from the TREES.

Ah, I see that I’ve caused Mary to start crying. Well, if you’re weeping
now, just wait ‘til I get across the bridge to Lulu the Hippopatamus’s
house. I will be a living angel of death! The animals of the forest will
trample away from me, hollering, wooting, and whistling in fear and
agony as my blade swishes through the air leaving naught but grizzly
arcs of crimson fur and feathers in its wake! And then I’ll —

Ah, at last! A weeping confession of guilt. And now the begging for
mercy begins. Well good ... good. Very good. I think we all learned a
little something today. Now, can I have your solemn promise that in the
future my fruit will remain unmolested? Thank you.
