  That thing I said about golf? I didn't mean it. Except for the part about the pants.

I have another word for you: Obvious Crapgiver!

First you gave me a copy of the [Tiger Woods 2001
Demo](https://web.archive.org/web/20001221000000/http://fileplanet.com/index.asp?section=343&file=53583)
burned onto a CD. Like I couldn't just download it myself. You didn't
even giftwrap it. You're an ass. Besides, I already have the full game.

Next, you give me this golfball that's obviously been *used!* Look it's
*dirty* Holkins! You've been golfing with this ball, and I'm on to your
tricks. No wait, be quiet, I'm not done yet. And this club? It looks
like you got it at a yard sale! I took one practice swing at the wall of
the conference room and bent the whole thing out of whack. Even the
grips are all worn out -- you didn't even *try* to make it look new. For
God's sake it's got your name engraved onto the handle!

And another thing, as a secret Santa, you should at least *try* to keep
your identity a secret. I mean, hence the name, you dig? But no! You
left my gifts just sitting right by your desk, so I took 'em. That's
pretty pathetic, all told, but you want to know the most pathetic thing?
I'll tell you -- I don't even PLAY golf! I hate golf! It's an idiot
sport for idiots in stupid pants! Some research you did, you fat assed
not-so-secret-secret-santa-wannabe! Weakness! WEAKNESS!

What do you mean you're not my secret Santa? Oh. Oh ... oh. Sorry about
the club.
