Well, let's think it out, right? So, we're playing ten-on-ten games of
[*Battlefield
1942*](http://web.archive.org/web/20020828000000/http://www.fileplanet.com/files/110000/111652.shtml).
You and me? We're like the leaders of our team. They look up to us. They
count on us. And, so far, the best strategy we've come up with is the
"Horrifying Human Wave Attack."

Now, we know that this strategy worked for the Soviets in the Second
World War. They would pour out of forests the Germans thought impassible
like water gushing from a sieve. And after they were all dead, more
Russians kept coming, and more, and more. Eventually, it worked. But
see, I think the thing to remember is that the Russians had *Hundreds of
Thousands* of soldiers. We have ... well, ten, but I'd hardly count
Stewie 'cuz we can't stop him from camping the planes.

No, we've only got a handful of us. A typical Horrifying Human Wave
Attack consists of you, me, Aaron and Jeff running at a Sherman tank
with our knives out. It's not really that horrifying. In fact, it
scarcely counts as a "wave." Or, for that matter, an "attack."

I think our *new* strategy should take advantage of *Battlefield*'s many
vehicles and combined arms. Wait. Hang on. Hold up -- I'm -- I'm coming
up with a new plan. This is SHEER GENIUS. I've got it.

It's a little something I call the "Horrifying Wedge-Shaped Formation of
Kamakazi Jeeps." YES! Round up the boys, we're logging in!!
