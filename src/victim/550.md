  But how ... how can I turn $200 bucks into $1000? I'm just a college student. I've
  a feeling the plot is about to thicken.

It should’ve been the happiest day of my online character’s life. Lady
Gloria Perfectteeth [was to be wed in a beautiful mountaintop
ceremony](@/victim/546.md). I nearly wept tears of joy, even after
the best man called the groom a “Smacktard.” But then during the
ceremony somebody found out that in real life, I was a MAN. I mean,
sure, say whatever you want about ME, but don’t hold that against
Gloria! She’s a saint! Just look at her alignment!

Well, by now everyone’s heard about the [burning](@/victim/546.md)
and the [looting](@/victim/547.md) that happened when the online
wedding went south. Oh, how I sobbed into my pillow! Uh ... I mean,
Gloria. GLORIA was sobbing into her pillow, being an emotional chick
like that.

To add insult to injury, two days later I found [her wedding ring up for
sale on eBay!](@/victim/548.md) It was unmistakably the one from the
wedding, being sold online. I bid a whopping $200 bucks on it, which was
crazy ‘cuz it was just a common +5 ring of defense. But [some other fool
bought it for twice that much!](@/victim/549.md) What was he? An
Idiot? Didn’t he know the ring was worthless but for sentimental value?

So I emailed him and asked what it would take for him to give me the
ring. “Oh, I wouldn’t part with this for less than $1000,” he typed
back. “The guy from eBay told me that this ring once belonged to *Nicole
Kidman.* I have a handwritten note to prove it.”

WHAT!? He’d been duped into believing that ring belonged to a movie
star? I hate people who misrepresent themselves over the net, and so
does Lady Gloria, with her long soft silky red hair.

But I MUST get that ring back! Without it I’ll never stop crying myself
to sleep at night! I mean ... Gloria ... Gloria will never ... C’mon
man, it’s ROLEplaying. It’s cool.
