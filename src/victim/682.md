It's not just that it's cool. It's downright *sexy* to go barefoot to a
party with hairy feet. Chicks are like, "Whoa," and you can be like,
"It's real, baby. Go ahead. Give it a tug."

No, I disagree. Hair grows naturally on the top of the foot. What, YOU
want to give it a tug? Go ahead!

The thing is, you have to nurture it. First, you shave your feet a few
times. It's like a beard, you know? It comes in a little thicker every
time you shave it all off.

Once you've got a nice patch of foot hair, you'll want to make the most
of it. It's not going to come in thick, not at first. That's why I get
down with the mascara. It's made for a woman but strong enough for a
man. And that lash-lengthening stuff. I like to get rich, luxurious fur.

Speaking of which, I only use herbal shampoos and conditioner on my
feet. A lot of ladies are gonna be stroking those things, so you need to
make sure they're soft and full of body.

I admit, I use product. But furry feet are the measure of a man, and I
take my dogs seriously.
