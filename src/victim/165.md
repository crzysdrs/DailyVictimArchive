I know it's harsh. Yeah yeah, I know he froze you and then firewalled
you, I got that. Pretty brutal. ... Right, but, what I'm saying is, I
don't think he was interested in "sharing" or spending any "quality
time" with you, especially since you were bragging about how you had the
Stone of Jordan.

See, often you can catch little hints and tip-offs that people aren't
going to play friendly. First, when he catalogued your loot in the chat
room before the game and told you how much killing you would be worth on
Ebay? It was subtle, but that's the kind of sign you should be looking
for.

Just before you joined the game with him, and he typed in the chat room
"Hang on lemme kill this guy real quick," there -- possibly -- was a
sign of malicious intent.

I'm not saying you should quit playing [Diablo
II](https://web.archive.org/web/20010406000000/http://www.planetdiablo.com/),
I'm just saying you should exercise a little more caution about which
servers you're going to play on if you want to play co-op. So, for
example, I would avoid the server called "LOOKING FOR MY 100TH KILL."
Just a hunch, it's probably bad news.
