Way. Dude, c'mere and whiff this.

No, I'm serious, I totally can't buy this game. What do you mean, why?
Sniffit, dude!

I don't give a good damn if the multiplayer rocks, this thing is big on
the rankness. It's all -- whoa.

You smell it, right? It's not just me?

This reminds me of that girl from the line at the movies last night, the
one who smelled like a broccoli baked potato? Seriously. I mean like,
cute and stuff, but TOTALLY IDAHO.

I'm putting the stenchness here back on the shelf. Oh -- oh crap -- oh
crap dude, now my hands smell like coconutness. Whiff 'em! No serious
c'mere and whiff 'em! Aw man, I gotta get me a moist towlette.
