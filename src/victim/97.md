  high so the neighbors know we got it.

Well, I can tell because a second ago the special "buying stuff" music
came on. And I'm pretty sure judging by the noises their Sims make when
they're watching TV that they needed a couch pretty bad.

I don't know why they're buying a new couch when they clearly need a
better stove. I just heard a house fire, probably 'cuz that one Sim
sounds like he can't cook. Oh hon, I don't think they're taking *nearly*
as good care of their Sims as we are. No sir-ee.

Sounds like a real slum down there. Regular third world. Oh â€” oh shh!
Listen, I can hear their Sims fighting now. Well, there goes the
neighborhood.
