No, relax, it's just a formality. This is a 64-player server and in the
evenings its packed, so before we allow just anyone to camp the airplane
spawns for the entire time we like them to submit an application. We
want to make sure that you'll mesh well with the rest of us, right? That
is to say, the other dozen of us ALSO camping the plane spawn. Hour
after hour. Ignoring the rest of our team. Or the mission objectives.
Anyways, on to the form!
