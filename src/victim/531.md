  Here, follow me to my locker. What do you mean, 'how do we get airplanes into this
  thing?' They're DWARVEN planes, duh. They built them with STREAM.

Alright guys, listen up, ‘cuz we need to figure this out before Study
Hall ends. We’re gonna be the first 13 year olds to ever publish a full
massively-multiplayer game, but since our budget consists of lunch money
we gotta be smart about this.

That’s why we should code the entire thing using the Macromedia Flash MX
30-day free trial. This is good all the way around. Not only is it free,
but it also gives us a hard deadline to work from. We just need to work
really fast. I figure we’ll spend the next couple of days planning, and
then we can do the majority of work over Christmas break. Maybe after we
get back, we can release the Beta.

Hey wait, slow down. One question at a time. Yes, Jim, you can draw
pictures of Orcs. Okay Jason, we’ll work in airplanes somehow. Ah! Randy
has a good question: How we can do four years’ worth of work in 30 days?
THAT’s the easy part.

Four years is just 48 “man-months.” So, all we need is 48 people to work
on the game. I figure we’ll bring in 50 and then we’ll have time to
spare. All that means is we have to recruit Mr. Weimer’s sixth and
seventh period Computer classes. Done!

So, let’s divvy up the work before we break. Gary, you do the 3D engine.
Randy? You make all the models of the characters and monsters. I’ll work
on the real-time strategy-game army battles interface, and Jason can add
the flight-sim part. Okay already, Jim, I already said you can draw
pictures of Orcs, geez.

Okay, I’ll download the free trial in two days so make sure we’ve got
our act together! There’s the bell -- go go go!
