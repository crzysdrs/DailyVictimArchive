Joy unbridled! twenty-five whole cents, just sitting here on the floor,
covered in a sticky brown substance of unknown origin but nonetheless
bona-fide U.S. currency. Combined with the five other quarters in my
pocket, it will buy me exactly one game of *any* machine in this Arcade!

Fortunately things are easier. When I was a tyke there were horrifying
choices to be made in the video arcade — space games and war games and
jumping games and monster games and maze games and climbing games and
and tank games and all sorts of stuff that I can't even describe like
that game with the bricks and the ball and the paddle. Twenty-five cents
gave you a blinding array of choice back then. It was frightening. The
mere sight of a quarter and I had to run and hide and breathe through a
paper bag.

Nowadays it is easy. I simply need to decide: Do I play the one-on-one
fighting game, the sit-down racing game, or the stand up and shoot a
light gun game? Once I narrow it down, the choices are easy, since
they're all the same.

Okay, my mind is made up. *Cruisin' San Francisco Rush Daytona 2049 Off
Road World*. At only six quarters per credit I can play for seven, even
eight back-to-back seconds.

Wait ... wait what's this? No — different cars — do I take the buggy
or the jeep? Ahh ... ahhhhhh ... paper bag! Paper bag!
