  Well, sure, I suppose technically you COULD hook up a mouse and keyboard to the
  console, but then it wouldn't feel like a CONSOLE, now, would it? Hand me the condensed
  soup.

I call it, “Sonny Jackson’s Patent-Pending Fragopheliac.”

You see, the trouble with playing first-person shooters on consoles
isn’t about graphics. No sir, those Xbox games look FIIINE. Nope, the
problem is trying to aim, strafe, run, and shoot simultaneously with a
handheld controller. Oh, and you should be able to glance quickly behind
you, too.

It’s easy with a mouse and keyboard, which respond instantly and take
into account the velocity of your flicking wrist as you aim. But until
now it was impossible on a console system -- that is, until the nine
months research and development I put into the Fragopheliac
(Patent-Pending.) I’ve combined the power of a trackball, mousewheel,
six-button firing array, triple-analog stick precision controller with a
seven button joystick/throttle/racing wheel combo. Then I threw in a
couple of dials and knobs you might use for special circumstances.

The 42-pound control array (it’s heavy due to the six servo-motor
vibration feedback modules and gyroscopic balancing sequencizer
\[Patent-Pending\]) requires a custom-made harness and backbrace to hold
up properly, and for legal reasons I’m requiring gamers to sign
liability waivers before using them in actual gameplay. I’ve offloaded
some of the weight by using a separate AC power supply. Watch your step
there -- the cord connecting it to the console is over an inch in
diameter and sizzles flesh to the touch.

Did you sign the paperwork? Okay, now you try it! Use the trackball here
to aim your crosshairs while circling around with the knob here -- just
don’t push the -- You pushed it, didn’t you? Well, nothing will stop the
smoke now. Sure, it’s got a few bugs to work out, but until then, pull
the emergency release cord and join me in the bunker for some canned
food.
