  Hang on, lemme light up a cigarette and I'll tell you more about the brain-beast.
  Did I mention that he lays his eggs inside of bags of M&Ms? Stop crying. Oh, now
  it's time to play Tetris, you say? I'm game.

How long have you sat there playing that Nintendo? Don't you have
homework? Do you know what time it is? I don't care if you're about to
find the secret Yoshi level. You skipped lunch, didn't you? No, a
handful of pepperoni and a Mountain Dew does not constitute lunch.

I think it's about time we made something clear. Just because I am your
stepmother does not mean I am not concerned for your welfare. My last
eight stepchildren would vouch for this, were they not eaten alive,
screaming and squirting blood like punctured balloons.

You see, living beneath the soil, just below the worms, lies a wrinkled
brain-beast who has as many eyes as I have hair on my head. His job is
to devour humans alive, but he has no teeth. Just tentacles and gums.
And he mashes people to death, screaming, until he can filter them
through his siphon-like esophagus. For him, milk is a terrible, terrible
poison. That's why I drink it all the time.

Understand that the noises you hear in the basement are the brain-beast.
Also, whenever you close your eyes, he's sneaking up behind you. He has
severed eyestalks that live in your closet at night, watching you.
Furthermore, he hates pro wrestling. Oh, and it scares him off when you
let me play Tetris.

But fortunately, you aren't a helpless little boy! You're not being
masticated within his oozing maw, caked with the pasty remains of mashed
foes past, and you may yet live. If you drink your milk. Whoa -- hold on
-- is that Yoshi? How did you find Yoshi? Do it again!
