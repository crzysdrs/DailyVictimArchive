As you may have already heard, Dave here -- the man holding his head in
his hands in the corner -- attempted to download the *Call of Duty* demo
this weekend over the University's connection. As you well know, the IT
department enforces a strict 5-gig weekly upload/download limit on all
student computers using the dorm room connections.

Dave woke up yesterday morning to discover that he was ... yes ...
1.5-gigs over the limit. Did he misjudge the size of the *Call of Duty*
demo? Was there an unexpected traffic spike? Was his web browser
secretly refreshing popups? Or is it because he inadvertently left a
file called brittney.mpg in his Kazaa shared directory? We will never
know, because Dave gets choked up when he talks about it.

That very morning he got the sternest of reaming from the IT department,
and they shut off his access to the University T1 for one week. For the
next seven days, Dave has only a 56K modem. Now, you'll see that Dave is
not outright *sobbing*, but note that his pupils refuse to dilate. Dave,
man, we're really sorry. No *PlanetSide* online. No *Wolfenstein Enemy
Territory*. Even your email loads slowly.

Gentlemen, please. Remove your Cat5 cables -- we will have a moment of
network silence. Okay, plug 'em back in. Time to play some *Desert
Combat!* Wooo WOOOO!! (Sorry Dave.)
