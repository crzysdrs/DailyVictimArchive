Get off me! Look at me. Do I look like a man with an iron will? Do you
see this will? Any iron in it? No! Hand me the discs!

Why? Because the Imperial March is in my head. That's right, Darth
Vader's theme from the movies. Well, I can hear it in my head, like I
got John Williams up my wazoo.

And when you got Williams Wazoo, you got no choice. Either you fire up
the DVD movies and throw food at the screen whenever they say
"Midichlorians." Or you play *Galaxies*. I'm a *Galaxies* man. See?

Don't try to stop me. You hear that? Of course you don't hear it -- it's
in my head. Dum dum dum dum da dum dum da dum, DUM DUM DUM DUM DA DUM,
DUM DA DUM! Yep. Fork over those CDs and close the door on your way out.

It's beyond my control now.
