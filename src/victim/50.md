blurb: >
  You heard me, oh yes you heard me, Mr. Gross! Soon you might very well begin a gesture
  that could possibly be described as the trembling, and then in all likelyhood the
  disctinct probablility of perhaps maybe the weeping!

That's right, Mr. Gross. You think your Age of Empire skillz will go
unchallenged. You think your Persian war elephants are unstoppable.
Well, I have a message for you, Mr. Gross. I have a message loud and
clear. That's right: Very shortly, I may in fact make with the throwing
down of something resembling a gauntlet.

Are you hearing me, Mr. Gross, sir? That's right, I'm addressing you --
or, more specifically, your ability to reach the Castle age in seventeen
minutes and 27 seconds. I'm speaking to your ability to beat two of us
in a multiplayer game with the help of only a single computer ally.

My words -- you should mark them! Because, when you least expect it, *I*
will guantlet throw you with the making of the down, or something along
those lines.

That's right.

Read my lips, sir. Your war elephants might fall before something
resembling my cataphracts. Your walls could very well crumble before the
rams of mostly battering. And your elephants could possibly tremble
before the stabbing of some very probably elongated pointy things or
somesuch.

Oh yes, Mr. Gross, something sort of like a bell might toll for you at
some later date once the throwing of the downward headed guantlet-like
substance commences. Ph34r.
