  Now, let's talk about Ripley, our new head engineer. This morning I saw him in the
  server room asking why "none of these machines have monitors." ... dude.

Look I’m not trying to be too hard on Roy or anything. I’m not saying I
don’t *like* his Mohawk. Or the jewelry. Or the studs on his pants that
rip up the conference room furniture.

All I’m saying is that we might have been a little hasty bringing him on
board as the head of Client Services just because he’s the best at
flying the airplanes at our LAN parties. No no, he’s a NICE guy, but the
VP of our third biggest account started sweating bullets in our latest
project status conference when Roy stood up and asserted: “We don’t code
our products for *SMACKTARDS*.”

He then lit a match with the fly of his jeans and started smoking a
hand-rolled cigarette.

Well, no, I’m not trying to question Roy’s ability to manage our
customer relationships, although we should take a good hard look at
that. And I’m definitely not questioning his ability to fly a plane and
hit an enemy tank no matter what the altitude. I’m just drawing to your
attention that we may not have the *best* hiring process. Or any hiring
process, for that matter, short of throwing LAN parties. With drinking.
We still haven’t found the cat after the last one. And somehow the next
day we had two new guys on our board of directors, one of whom can only
speak Cantonese and communicates mostly by pointing to things and making
machine-gun gestures accompanied by noises with his lips.

It’s just a procedural question, that’s all...
