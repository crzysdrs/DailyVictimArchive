  These are subtle, subtle clues. But I think they add up to a meaningful conclusion.

Well, it took less than half a minute to compile, completely error-free.
Although that may be a testament to the superb coding talents at Valve,
it is but the first of many clues that cause me to question the validity
of this file that you got "from some guy who knows this guy who used to
be on IRC."

The associated "content files" are extremely small. 8K, as a matter of
fact, for the "combine" level. I have emails longer than 8K. No, I'm not
doubting the superb abilities of Valve's coders to create some
incredible compression techniques, I'm just noting that the file is
about as big as an animated forum icon. In fact, if you open it, it IS
an animated forum icon. One of those dancing anime chicks with the
independently-moving breasts. Things like this, you know, make me
question the authenticity of the source code that you have. Which would
fit, in its entirety, on a floppy disk.

I question some of the filenames. Although this IS a beta, I'm skeptical
that Valve would actually compile their flagship product into a single
executable named "u\_r\_gay.exe."

And finally, the executable that this source code creates would appear
to be a Strawberry Shortcake screensaver.
