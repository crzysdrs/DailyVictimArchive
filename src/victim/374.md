You! Little man. I've heard enough of your lip. I've worked the
convention circuit for thirteen years — Union ID 6044840 — and I've
seen stuff that would shrink a man's testicles. Take this here Nintendo
booth. We like to call it "Never-endo." It'll take us over a week to put
this booth together — but that's just on the surface. In reality this
booth is a part of history. Like the Great Wall of China. You know how
many people died while building this booth again and again year after
year? Seventeen. Union boys, each and every one. We don't slow down any
here — just bow our heads, the Chaplin here says a few words, and then
we carpet over the body and plant a Kiosk where they fell. I can't even
remember the name of the guy underneath the Starfox display here. A good
man. Kept riveting until the blood loss killed him.

This year it looks like we'll pull through. Look at Janice there. Fell
off a ladder this morning, they stapled together the wounds and she's
back up on the scaffolding. The show goes on, cheesepuff. Like a hockey
game. Stitch 'em up and get 'em back in there. So stop your whining
about the severed arm, put the hammer in your other hand, and GET BACK
ON THAT BOOTH BOY.
