  Hey, hey! Scoot over ladies, I can't reach the gearshift. I could be on the moon
  by now, but instead I'm going to my condo in the city with you two and a trunk full
  of dirty movies. Life is cruel.

I wish I had done a little more reading before I bought my new jet-black
Ferrari 456M GT with the v12 engine. Sure, my new car accelerates like a
fighter jet and drives at skin-melting speeds in unparalleled comfort,
but *it canâ€™t go into space*.

What brought this up? Well, none other than computer game designer John
Carmack. In this [CNN article about space
travel](http://web.archive.org/web/20021018000000/http://www.cnn.com/2002/TECH/space/10/16/xprize.contest/index.html),
Carmack tells us: "I thought to myself, you know, for less money that I
spend on Ferraris the past decade, I think I can make my own spaceship."

DAMMIT! If only I had known that *before* I bought my Ferrari, I could
be knocking on the window of the international space station and asking
if they had any Grey Poupon by now. I could be an interstellar
cosmonaut, surfing the spacewaves with one foot on the gas and another
in the *future*.

But instead, all I have is a lousy Italian sports car with two
half-naked women making out in the passenger seat.
