What -- wait -- what do you call *that?* A cheat code? You’re *CHEATING*
in *Animal Crossing!?* Look here, I stood by in silence when you
[threatened to hatchet-murder all the little
animals](@/victim/469.md), and I even kept my trap shut when [Greg
drew a wee-wee on his door](@/victim/474.md). But here? Here I draw
the LINE!

What are you doing? You’re duplicating items? And now you just spawned
in a pile of money? Oh ... oh you JERK. This isn’t like cheating at
*Contra* or something, where you just generate ammo so you can kill more
bad guys. I’m all for killing bad guys. It’s their ability to be killed
that makes them so inherently *bad*.

No, this is cheating THE LITTLE ANIMALS OF THE FOREST. Not to mention
your roommates, who have worked hard picking cherries and catching fish
just to buy bigger houses. No, you slam in a cheat code and buy a
mansion, while Nook the Raccoon weeps silently from his straw mat at
night and Mitzi the cat wallows in poverty. You SICK BASTARD.

Think of the animals, man. Think of the animals!
