I don’t know much about world history, but what I *do* know I learned
from playing *Civilization III*. For instance: A large part of why the
Roman Empire fell was due to the Aztecs discovering gunpowder and the
steam engine. ‘strue!

But the one man I fear more than any other is the most dreaded cutthroat
barbarian the world has ever seen: Mahatma Ghandi. He, my friend, is the
conqueror of men! I should look this guy up and maybe learn a little
from his true story, but lemme tell you, in the game I’m playing now? I
quaked with fear when I saw him overrun the British homeland using war
chariots, enslaving their people. WILL HIS CRUEL REIGN OF TERROR NEVER
END?

As we enter the modern error I find myself face-to-face with this
hardened war criminal. He’s threatening us and demanding that we teach
him Atomic Theory. Ghandi! Emperor of the Indians! Atomic Theory? I can
only imagine what that war-crazed bloodthirsty madman will do once he
has his hands on that terrible knowledge!

I’ve got to put my foot down. No, Ghandi, no! Your jackbooted reign of
fury ends here! I’m going to bring my best troops out to guard our
borders. I’ll fight you off the same way Abraham Lincoln fought off the
Chinese, thus ensuring his place in history! Step off, Ghandi! I mean
it.
