Yah, you know Max, Chad's roommate? The guy who's worked fast food since
he was 16? Nice guy and all, but impossible to talk to. It's like he's
got a bad router up there or something. It feels like one of us has a
bad ping. No no, listen, it goes something like this:

**Me:** Hey Max! What's up? Didja see the new [Max Payne
Preview](http://web.archive.org/web/20010709000000/http://www.gamespy.com/previews/july01/maxpayne/)
on GameSpy this weekend?

**Max:** Yo.

**Me:** Is Chad home? Can I grab a beer? I'm good for it.

**Max:** I can't wait to shoot some guys in slow-motion.

**Me:** Right, I'll just, uh, hold off on the beer then. When's Chad
supposed to be home?

**Max:** Did you see him running through that burning building?

**Me:** Who, Chad?

**Max:** Sure, have a beer, they're not mine.

**Me:** ...yeah, I think I need one now. So you dug Max Payne?

**Max:** He'll be here soon.

**Me:** Who, Max Payne or Chad?

**Max:** Yeah.

**Me:** Oh ... oh God, just stop talking.

**Max:** Uh hunh. Chad.
