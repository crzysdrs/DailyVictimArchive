Not only is "State of Emergency" rated as a "Mature" game, but it's got
a stickah on the box that says "Warning: Check ID." It might as well say
"Keep away from Kip." I've tried eight stores and none of them let me
buy the wares, even when I tried to sandwich it in between two Freddi
Fish games.

This is discrimination-ization against us 11 year olds! The Man is
openly dissing my ability to front. At stake is my supposed inability to
throw down.

Look, it's not like I'm some first-grader who doesn't know the
difference between an uzi and an AK. I gots what you'd call ... PHAT
gats, yo. Maybe the Man is worried that little Kippy might start a riot
at the local mall, just because a game taught me how. That's crazy. I
like the mall, and wouldn't want to damage them bitchin' horsies outside
of Whattapretzel.

Instead, I would apply my newfound riot-starting skillz to places where
it would benefit my fellow bruthas. Such as the playground. Or Billy
Wendal's house. 'Cuz he's a jerkface. You people act like I've got no
sense of reality! But look at me! I dressed myself. These chains be
gold-colored plastic from that vending machine outside of Fatburger. You
know how long a man has to hold down a papah-route to be bustin out the
mad jewelz like these? DAYS, boy-ee. I've proven myself as a mature,
responsible gangsta. I just wants me some State of Emergency. Is that so
wrong?

I will cut you.
