- Memory cards cost mucho buck-ets. Simply pause your game and leave it
on. Forever, if neccessary.

- Used games are a ripoff. They give you $5 to turn one in, yet charge
up to $30 when you buy those exact same games from them. Instead, simply
stand outside and offer customers $10 for their used games. Everybody
wins! You will need a variety of different hats, wigs, and fake
mustaches to do this in front of the same store for more than a couple
hours.

- Get as many girlfriends as possible shortly before your birthday. Dump
them before theirs.

- New controllers cost money. Break yourself of the habit of biting them
between rounds of Tony Hawk.

- Consider charging your no-good friend Stu a quarter everytime he plays
a round of Tekken.

- Overcome your costly "food" addiction.
