Lemme give you some advice: never go to a Halloween party dressed as the
fat half-naked zombie guy from *Doom III*. It’s almost impossible to get
your freak on.

I mean, let’s face it: Halloween is a time for making out. Our pagan
forefathers created the holiday with “naughty nurse” outfits in mind.
When I went to Jenn’s Halloween party, I was ready for some serious
undead undulating, if you no what I mean.

But nobody -- NOBODY -- wants to get it on with the fat undead guy from
*DOOM*. What’s the dealio?

In one corner I saw Sophitia from *Soul Calibur* making out with Dante
from *Devil May Cry.* Right after the apple bobbing I nearly tripped
over Solid Snake getting down with Pai from *Virtua Fighter 4*. Even
Krystal from the *Star Fox* game was getting fresh with the *Grand Theft
Auto* guy, and hell, she’s like ... a purple dog or something.

But then, from across the crowded room, standing next to a dry-ice
cauldron of floating eyeballs, I saw her. [Helga Von
Bulow](http://web.archive.org/web/20021031000000/http://www.planetwolfenstein.com/features/dearhelga/),
the evil fat Nazi woman from [Castle
Wolfenstein](http://web.archive.org/web/20021031000000/http://www.planetwolfenstein.com/).
Her hair was so tightly woven into the bun it made the veins in her
forehead pop out alluringly.

I sidled up to her, my big fake fat blood-spattered gut jostling as I
moved my legs. “Hey baby,” I said. “We’re both from Quake-engine games.
You’re a Nazi and I’m undead -- it’s practically the same thing. Let’s
get it on.”

Together, silhouetted before the harvest moon, we walked out into the
pumpkin patch together arm-in-arm.
