Hunh? Speak up! The screeching you hear is the horrifying discordant
wail of four Jigglypuffs howling their miserable song. See, I thought it
would be a good idea to let all my nieces and nephews play with my
Nintendo GameCube while they stayed with me for the week, and so far all
they've mastered are four-way Jigglypuff fights in *Smash Bros.*

Say again? No, you gotta really wail man, I can't hear a thing. If it's
not the howling horror of Jigglypuff screeching his song, it's them
between matches screaming about who gets to be the Jigglypuff wearing
the green headband. They call him RamPuff.

Can you hear it over the phone? Let me tell you, from here the sound in
my living room is like four full-sized jet engines warming up, except
the intakes are sucking in whipped cream and stringed instruments
instead of air.
