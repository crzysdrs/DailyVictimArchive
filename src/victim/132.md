Let's be honest, you and I. With a monitor like mine, you only have
21-inches to work with. And how big is 21 inches? It's less than two
feet. So you gotta make the most of it. That's why mine's set to
5120x3840 resolution.

It takes a lot of work to crank it up that high, but it's worth it. I
had to code the drivers myself. And then, hacking the software -- that,
my friend, was quite the chore. But, even though I often get only 6 or 7
frames per second, the extra level of detail is worth it.

Let me elaborate. Just the other day I was playing Counter-Strike on
de\_dust. I felt so much like I was there that I could feel the sand
between my toes. I looked down at the ground and I could see each
individual grandule of dirt. In fact, I was so stunned I missed the
whole opportunity to buy weapons. Not that I could tell -- at that
resolution, the menu is a postage-stamp sized lump in the corner. I'm
lucky to even *see* the guns, much less select them! But it's worth it.
Why? Because I could walk up to crates and not just see the woodgrain, I
could see the fingernail marks of the mapper who coded the level.
S'true.

Details like that make it worth it. A few moments later I was admiring
the texture of brick near the big red spraypainted X. I heard the
beeping of the bomb-like device. I think my teammates were shouting at
me to defuse it -- but I couldn't hear them. Their text was smaller than
the microdot writing you see at the bottom of certified checks. Besides,
I couldn't even *see* the bomb.

You know what I *did* see? An ant. That's right, only at resolutions
this high can you actually see the wildlife. He crawled slowly across
the dirt and gravel. I watched him. I could see each and every pebble. I
saw each little antennae, each tiny, tiny leg whirling as the little
tiny creature of God moved forward.

I couldn't help but lean closer and closer to my screen to watch the
mechanical marvel of nature go about his tiny, tiny business while
around him men killed one another fruitlessly over ideological concerns.
Suddenly -- when my face was nearly touching the screen -- I realized
that it was a real ant, crawling across my monitor.

And then the bomb went off and killed me. The light was so blindingly
bright, I haven't seen anything but yellowish red blurs for days. I may
have to up the subscription on my glasses again. Some people would look
upon that as a terrible prospect, but I merely see it as an opportunity
to prepare my optics for the strain of 7680x5760.
