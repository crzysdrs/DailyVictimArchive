I don't mean to [cast unsupported suspicion at you](@/victim/70.md),
Crenshaw, but perhaps you'd like to help me correborate the facts. I'm
not saying that the Counter-Strike server we found surreptitiously
hooked into our network inside the server room is yours. I'm just
curious why, then, your initials were printed neatly on the back of the
mysterious machine with a black magic marker, and why the hardrive is
named "Crenshaw CS Serv."

Also, two weeks ago I have recorded in my journal a curious event where
you asked me if I had any spare network cable, while holding a
Counter-Strike CD. I reminded you that company hardware was not to be
used for gameplay, at which point you grinned ... *broadly* ... and said
no problem. I've had my eyes on you, Crenshaw.

Great pains were taken to hide the unauthorized server machine by the
perpetrator. It was hidden behind a cardboard box — coincidentally an
old mail package addressed to "D. Crenshaw." It was also hidden behind
the server rack under a blanket whose tag reads, "To Davy with love,
Grandma Crenshaw." This evidence may be circumstantial. However, it is
hard to refute your knowledge of said server by these leaflets I found
in the photocopier tray advertising "CRENSHAW'S CRACKDOWN Phat LAN
party!" this upcoming weekend *in this building* listing our company IP
address as the server location.

I'm beginning to see a connection here, Crenshaw. The pieces are falling
into place.

Are you aware that a single Counter-Strike server uses up 30 times our
alotted bandwidth budget? Do you know that that single server cost us
$96,000 in unplanned charges this past month? You realize our company
his filed for bankruptcy and that I have been fired? But that's not my
point, Crenshaw — I got off topic.

The fact is, I must now come around to the damning accusation. That's
right, Crenshaw:

Why wasn't *I* invited to that LAN party?
