You heard me, Hasbro! When I caught word that you were [closing all of
the *Wizards of the Coast*
stores](http://web.archive.org/web/20031230000000/http://www.tribnet.com/entertainment/story/4565058p-4537928c.html),
me and all my D&D-loving, dice-rolling, card-collecting, board-gaming
buddies took up arms and stormed the mall.

Here we are, and we *aren't leaving!*

You can't take away our *WotC* stores. Where else am I going to find
wicked cool boardgames like *Attack?* Or D&D modules that I always buy
but never get around playing, so I just flip through them and think of
really cool scenarios? What about those? How about those cool six-sided
dice with the skulls for the "1" pip? WHO WILL PROVIDE THIS ESSENTIAL
SERVICE?

Well, we're not gonna take it. We're nerds, and we're gonna be heard!
We're geeky, and we're gonna be sneaky! We're dorks, and we're gonna ...
\[Hey guys, help me out here. Dorks? Sporks? Forks? Throw me a bone...\]

Okay, no matter. Here's the plan. Me and all my buds are gonna camp out
at this Wizards store from dawn 'til closing, EVERY DAY. And we're gonna
line up at these tables here, and we're gonna be ANGRY! And we're gonna
play *Magic* or *Pokemon* or *Lord of the Rings* collectable card games,
and we're gonna shout incomprehensible things about Desolation Angels or
beta Black Lotus cards. Also, we're not going to shower.

I guess it's not really that different than it is now.

Except we're ANGRY.
