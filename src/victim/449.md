  Also, my cordless mouse needs new bateries, but I'm afraid to change them, because
  it might not help any and then I'd feel even worse.

I'm what you would call a "Late Adopter," meaning until just last week I
was still grinding it out on a 56K modem. You remember what it's like
playing action games on narrowband, right? I would play *Counter-Strike*
on the Italy map and camp out near the radio with a sniper rifle, then
some guy would appear and stutter-step into the alley while I slammed on
my mouse button, and somehow a moment later I was dead.

"LAG!!!" I would type.

With my new cable modem, I no longer have to worry about connection
problems. In fact, I get a ping of under 50 to my favorite server.
Everything is silky smooth. It's like being in the *real* Italy. It's
changed my whole gameplay style! Now I camp next to the radio using an
*AK-47*.

But that's beside the point. My point is, the guy comes busting around
the corner into the alley and I started slamming onto my mouse button,
peppering that whole alley with bullets like I was pouring sprinkles on
a cake. The guy crouched beside a crate, took a shot, and blew me across
the room, dead.

"LAG!!!" I started to type, and then I realized something ... it wasn't
the lag at all.

I just really, really suck. And I have ... all along.
