\[Part II of *Dance Dance Story*. [Read Part I!](@/victim/586.md)\]

Oh yes, gentlemen. See here. The secret is that I’ve got flared raver
pants on *underneath* the rolled-up jeans that are two-sizes too big. I
can’t help but *walk* with a serious rhythm now. No *DDR* machine can
resist my grooves. Hell, you can’t even tell what buttons I’m standing
on.

If I were to jump from the second level of the mall, I would float down
to the first.

But now, let’s get down to it, my brothers from Team ManyMojo. What I
plan to do is head over to the Arcade on the East Side of the mall with
you guys and wreck it with the quickness. I have a two part plan for
busting that arcade wide open and leaving Team ShakaBooty dance-dancing
in our DUST:

1. We will raise da roof  
 2. We will set it on fire.

We won’t need any water; we’re going to let it burn. But before we
rumble the footpads, let’s stop by the Food Court to hydrate. Otherwise
we’ll end up like that [shriveled up dude who’s still outside the
software store waiting for *TeamFortress 2*](@/victim/307.md).

AHHhhHHHhh, yes boys, God’s gift to ravers is none other than the rich
iciness of Orange Julius-- GOOD SWEET MOTHER man, hold your tongues!
Look over there, next to the Piercing Pagoda! What lady is that,
ordering a chocolate chip cookie the size of my head? OH! She does teach
the neon signs outside Spencer’s Gifts to burn bright!

I *have* to talk to her. Look, but don’t all look at once. Okay, I’m
going to make my move. Wait here. Er, hey guys? Do these pants make my
butt look big? ...Can you even tell what direction I’m facing?
