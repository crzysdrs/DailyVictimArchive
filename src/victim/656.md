  You see, that kind of pessimistic attitude is *exactly* why this genre is stagnating.
  Hand me a beer, eh?

I see it now, a full 1:1 scale representation of the vast frozen lakes
of Nova Scotia, available online year round. And on those lakes,
thousands of curlers, accompanied by thousands of sweepers, watched over
by thousands of guys on the sidelines drinking virtual beer.

I line up my shot. Whoosh! It's away! The tension mounts as it crosses a
vast expanse of ice, where hundreds of other stones (some +2 or more) go
whizzing by from every angle, each one more threatening than the last.
Broomers are everywhere. Fights break out. It's a slippery,
beer-swilling chaos.

At last my stone slows to a stop ... BULLSEYE! There it is, lined up in
the center of the circle amidst a pack of a couple dozen other stones
from teams all around the world. Will it stay there? Will it be knocked
free? All I have to do is wait for 1500 other curlers to take their shot
before I find out ...

Guys? C'mon guys, are you with me on this one?
