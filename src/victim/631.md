When I play [*Madden
2004*](https://web.archive.org/web/20030814000000/http://gamespy.com/reviews/august03/maddennfl2004xbox/),
I play for keeps. You've got to keep your head low and your opponent's
quarterback even lower.

I play with nerves of steel and eyes on every player. My defenders cover
the backfield like mayo on a sandwich. But the cornerstone of my
strategy is when we're in the red zone.

I call it, "The end-zone interception 99-yard run for a touchdown"
strategy.

You'd think that this would be a hard strategy to reliably pull off, but
I've got it down to a science. My opponent will crush and rush, scrimp
and pummel, FIGHT his way for every inch of grass ALL the way down the
field, only to get picked off outside the end zone so that I score a
99-yard touchdown. I'm like a Swiss watchmaker, except with
interceptions. Then I kick it off and we begin the process again,
letting him run down the clock for me.

Hell, my offense doesn't even take the field. Ever.

I wonder why they haven't tried this in the NFL?
