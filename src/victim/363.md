  Oh CRAP I seemed to have driven mine weapon into that dude's eye. Well, serves him
  right. Maybe I can just close the window and get back to my game -- hang on -- hold
  up -- where's my CD!?

That's right, suck steel, you Khajiit bastard! Although you can't see my
face behind this stolen helm, it's snarling under all of its scar
tissue. I didn't spend the last three days forswearing meals and sleep,
calling in sick from work, building my *Morrowind* character into a
sword-brandishing vessel of pain and misery, just so *you* could keep
those greaves. Hah!

What's that? This game is so realistic I swear I can smell the food this
dead Khajiit was cooking -- whoa, wait. No, that's ... barbecue. I smell
barbecue. Lemme open the window... Yes, those guys in the apartment
downstairs are grilling hot dogs on the patio. Madness! I can't stop
playing, I only just now got my stronghold... But look at them down
there ... oh the sizzling meaty goodness ... I haven't eaten since 2:30
AM last night, when I poured the last of the corn flake crumbs into my
mouth. Ungh. I'm drooling. Those bastards! Tormenting me with hotdoggy
goodness, right under my window!

Hang on, the cretin in the chef hat, his back is turned. I didn't spend
the last two days building my character's missile-weapon skill without
learning a few tricks of the trade myself. Maybe I can spear one of
those hot dogs by making a makeshift harpoon out of this sharpened
pencil and some string. Oh yah. Yah, that's the good stuff. Take aim,
take aim ... FOR THE GLORY OF THE EMPIRE, I POKE AT THEE, NOURISHING
DOG!

[![](/img/victimpics/thesauce.gif)](@/victim/118.md)That's right,
boys. I'll keep [distracting him with the 'dogs](@/victim/118.md),
you guys creep into his apartment and swipe the Morrowind disk. Shh!
Don't look, I think I just felt some drool hitting my hat. Act casual,
I'm gonna glance up and see if he's taking the bait ... AAUUUGH GOD MY
EYE! MY EYE!
