Look at him standing over there by the town crier -- he's the Elf, in
the shirt? Yeah, it took him *twenty minutes* to pick out that
hairstyle. And another five minutes to choose the perfect shade of
"glistening platinum blonde" (his words).

We started playing together because I thought we would do quests, or
kill things, or hunt orcs, or -- hell, I'd even be happy just drinking
ale in the pub with my guild. Like I used to do after classes with the
gang back on campus.

But -- look at him! Just look at him. We spent two hours last night
going from merchant to merchant until he could find a leather
breastplate that matched his boots. That shirt? Custom tailored. Same
with the wristguards to match. And his backpack is full of other
clothes: he's got his formal attire, his ceremonial attire, his
dungeoning attire, his town wear, his beach wear, his Summer filking
outfit -- what the hell happened to him?

He insists on having both a brown pair of boots and a black pair of
boots on him at all times.

Last night he looked our cleric up and down and then said, "Oh honey,
you are *not* wearing *that* with *those*." Then he raised both his
hands and said "Giiiiii-iirl!" Afterwards, he made her put on a helmet
because "I can't stand to see that eye shadow clash with the pale blue
aura of the obsidian blade."

This morning I gave him a cloak of displacement that he refuses to wear
until he can "coordinate an ensemble."

The thing is, he's just a jeans and tee-shirt kind of guy around the
house. He acts all macho when he's got the guys over. I think this whole
online roleplaying thing triggered off some sort of latent
fashion-consciousness that he's been suppressing. Should I be worried?

...Can I just player kill him? Or is that bad for a marriage?
