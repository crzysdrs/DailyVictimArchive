  And why do they call this thing here a "ShuttleCock?" It is clearly neither.

California's [renewed power
problems](http://web.archive.org/web/20010127000000/http://www.cnn.com/2001/US/01/26/power.woes.01/index.html)
have forced me offline in a continuing [desperate search for analog
entertainment possibilities](@/victim/99.md). Today I am attempting
what insiders refer to as "Badminton." The appeal of a game that has
"bad" in the title is lost on me. How does one market these foolish
preoccupations? I am confused. However, according to the box, this game
is multiplayer -- which is why I have gathered you here, today.

So, then, the four of us, we're like two "clans," and we are competing
for the ... "court," this green arena-shaped level here. Now then, the
objective, as I understand it, is this "Birdie." I fail to see the
resemblence to any sort of fowl. It's white and has a red plastic
cranium. It looks very dangerous. I have no qualms about beating it,
hard.

So then, my [Bald, Unmployed Clanmate](@/victim/89.md) here will then
"serve" the "birdie" to your team. Ready? 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... FIGHT!

\*thwack\*

Ah ... ah yes, we seem to have hit a snag. See, your clanmate, [the
Woman with the Pengiun](@/victim/38.md), has caught the birdie and is
now defending it. The object is to "hit" the unpleasant pheasant back
over the "net" where I will attempt to smack it extremely hard with my
oblong bird-beating stick here. This is wholly unsatisfying. Is there
any way to reboot this server?
