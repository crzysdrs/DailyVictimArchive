Just give the ball to me, wee man!

The new [*Unreal Tournament 2003*
Demo](http://web.archive.org/web/20020916000000/http://www.fileplanet.com/files/110000/112991.shtml)
allows me to demonstrate to the world what TeamFortress SpazBall players
have known since 1998: I am a MONSTER on the court! My insane dribbling
puts the fear of God into man woman and child alike. Before me echoes a
cacophony of fire and pain, and in my wake naught is heard but weeping.

Just give the ball to me and your powers of observation will be rewarded
with a demonstration of skillz so outrageous, so perverse, that they are
technically legal only in Nevada.

Watch as I sidestep, instagib, and adrenal move my way across the court.
Note my opponent! See how he falls before my smiting blow! Note how the
real *Unreal* physics cause his body to crumple to its knees then remain
motionless as if to say a morbid prayer to me from the afterlife. If
only you had shown such respect early on, tinyman, I may have spared
your miserable obstacle of a life.

What’s my secret strategy? I’ll let you in on a secret: *I run towards
the goal*. Few possess my cunning.
