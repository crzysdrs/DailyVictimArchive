 **The Daily Victim**

Needless to say, I enjoy writing. And we were looking for a way that I
could get more of my writing on the site in a way that would build
traffic. The idea? THE DAILY VICTIM. I'd write a short piece every day,
accompanied by a quick sketch from Penny-Arcade's Gabe. The Daily Victim
was born. Users could rank victims and the highest-voted ones would
return, along with a full-color illustration.

Here's a great example of the Daily Victim in action. First, a group of
twenty-somethings [decide to bury a *Sinistar* Arcade
machine](@/victim/476.md) in the graveyard when it dies. Users liked
this victim so much that it returned for a sequel, [where the machine is
dug back up](@/victim/484.md). Hilarity ensues.

Halfway through the run of the Daily Victim, Gabe decided to turn his
full attention to the [Penny
Arcade](https://web.archive.org/web/20090206000000/http://www.penny-arcade.com/)
site, and after a brief hiatus the feature returned with the excellent
Lemuel "HotSoup" Pew providing the art. If you're interested, [HotSoup
now illustrates BlankIt
comics](https://web.archive.org/web/20090206000000/http://blankitcomics.com/),
which are a lot of fun.

I would've thought a daily feature like this would've done great traffic
for us. The people who read it *loved* it. To this day, I still get
emails and comments about the Daily Victim, more so than any other work
I've written. And I always felt it was some of my best writing on
GameSpy. But -- here's the cold reality of writing gaming editorial --
the traffic wasn't there. For all the work that I put into it, and the
money we spent on artists, the Daily Victim never got a ton of traffic.
Early in 2004 things came to a head -- I had brought aboard a third
artist and had sketched up a new redesign, but I couldn't justify the
resources to relaunch the Daily Victim site because of its low numbers.

If you're interested in what could have been, [here's a
mockup](/img/daily_victim_mockup.png) I had created of the site I wanted.
The site would read almost like a blog written by recurring characters.
It would've been years ahead of its time. Hold on a second -- now the
weeping -- okay, I'm better now.

It's fun to [read all the Daily Victims from the very
beginning](@/victim/11.md), but if you don't have that much time,
here are some of my favorites:

[**Special Halloween Victim of Unmitigated Horror**](@/victim/670.md)

[**Twinking People in Online RPGs**](@/victim/483.md)

[**Messing with the Guy Who Plays Majestic**](@/victim/275.md)  
 [**(...Which turns out to be a bad idea)**](@/victim/283.md)

[**The Sysadmin who *always* has a backup plan**](@/victim/356.md)

[**I've Defended This Flag Since You Were in Your Father's
Scrotum**](@/victim/17.md)

[**Trading EverQuest Lewt... For a Human Baby**](@/victim/54.md)

[**The Littlest Orc**](@/victim/413.md)

Finally, one of the best short stories I've felt I've ever written:

[**Creeping Horror at Palace Park Amusements**](@/victim/190.md)
