**Fargo:** Every day we run a feature here on GameSpy known as \[cues
drum roll machine\] [THE DAILY VICTIM](./). It's the subject of this
week's column!

**Gabriel:** When did we get a drum roll machine?

**Fargo:** We nabbed it when we bought Mplayer. So, Gabe, would you like
to read from your mailbag?

**Gabriel:** Sure — I got this note from Ovi "graphix" Demetrian:

{% css_class(style="color: #00AA00;") %}
*i've printed the first 100 or so of your
daily victims drawings at school and am kinda trying to do some drawings
and stuff, but i was wondering if u could do me a favor... like the next
daily victim u draw, can u like scan it in the steps u use to draw it?
like after u finish a step, then scan it, then do the next step and scan
it and so on? and then send me the steps to see how the magic
happens?*

[![](/img/columns/image/feb04_planetfargo_cards.png)](/img/columns/image/feb04_planetfargo_cardsbig.png)  
Victim ideas usually start on these yellow notecards I keep by my desk. You never know when
inspiration will strike.
{% end %}


**Fargo:** We thought it would be fun to do a whole, "Creating the Daily
Victim" column. We'll start with the creation of the image — 'cuz
that's sexy — and then we'll go on to how I whip up the writing. Maybe
it will inspire you. Maybe it will delight you. Maybe it'll pass some
time while you're microwaving a burrito. Anyways, today we're going to
look at [the frozen guy](@/victim/123.md), who was just posted
yesterday and scored really high in the voting.

**From the Beginning:**

**Gabe:** The creation of a Daily Victim usually starts out with Fargo
sending me an idea for a headline. The other way it can work is that I
just draw something wacky and send it to him.

**Fargo:** I keep a stack of yellow notecards by my desk at all times.
Often I'll be talking to someone about something and we'll say, "Hey,
that sounds like a Victim."

**Gabe:** In the case of this victim he sent me the headline about a guy
who's coworker keeps turning up the AC. So I drew this sketch of a dude
looking very cold and scanned it in. You can click on these pics to blow
them up:

<div class="center">
{% css_class(class="center caption") %}
[![](/img/columns/image/feb04_planetfargo_sketch.png)](/img/columns/image/feb04_planetfargo_sketchbig.png)  
The original sketch, all rough-lookin'.
{% end %}
</div>

**Fargo:** Well, they don't really, "Blow Up," per se. They just get
bigger. I wouldn't want our readers to get disappointed or anything.  

**Gabriel:** I should tell you right now this is the way I work and I'm
sure it's not the only or even best way to do this sort of thing. Once
I've scanned the sketch into Photoshop, I bring down the opacity on the
sketch layer so that I can trace over it on another layer.

<div class="center">
{% css_class(class="center caption") %}
[![](/img/columns/image/feb04_planetfargo_layers.png)](/img/columns/image/feb04_planetfargo_layersbig.png)  
Scanned into photoshop and ready for, uh, "inking." Click to enlarge.
{% end %}
</div>

**Fargo:** Take a pic of your Wacom tablet. Gabe does everything on a
Wacom tablet, a big giant one, he hardly uses his mouse anymore.

**Gabriel:** Okay, yah, here's the tablet:

<div class="center">
{% css_class(class="center caption") %}
![](/img/columns/image/feb04_planetfargo_tablet.png)  
Mad toolz.
{% end %}
</div>

**Gabriel:** The sketch is just there as a guide, lots of times I don't
even stick to it. I like to use a real thick line for the outside edge
of my characters and smaller lines for the detail work inside. This is a
common practice as far as cartoons go and I'm sure if you go to school
for this sort of thing they will even tell you it has a name.

<div class="center">
{% css_class(class="center caption") %}
[![](/img/columns/image/feb04_planetfargo_inking.png)](/img/columns/image/feb04_planetfargo_inkingbig.png)  
Tracing the outline. It helps to work with a really big image zoomed in.
{% end %}
</div>

**Gabriel:** Once I have my "inks" done I adjust the Brightness Contrast
setting. I like to call this part adjusting the Brightness/Contrast
setting. Basically I just drag both sliders all the way down. The reason
for this is two fold: First so that when it comes time to color the pic
I don't get those nasty white edges around my lines. You photoshop users
out there know what I'm talking about. Second...hmm I guess it was only
one fold.

<div class="center">
{% css_class(class="center caption") %}
[![](/img/columns/image/feb04_planetfargo_contrast.png)](/img/columns/image/feb04_planetfargo_contrastbig.png)  
Fine tooning.
{% end %}
</div>

**Gabriel:** The next and probably most important step in this process
is to load up [Front Line
Force](https://web.archive.org/web/20010201000000/http://www.planethalflife.com/frontline/)
and do my damndest to kick some rebel ass. Uhh, but don't tell Fargo
that.

**Fargo:** Don't tell me what?

**Gabriel:** Nuttin'.

**Fargo:** Then he emails the "inked" drawing to me. At this point, Gabe
is done; he's just gotta hope and pray that I don't screw it up. Isn't
that right?

**Gabriel:** \[Is already playing Front Line Force.\]

**Fargo:** Riiiiight....  

**Fargo:** So, Gabe sends me a final, inked version of the Victim. I
don't do anything more with the art — I crop out the head to make the
thumbnail image for the front page, but that's about it. Then I open up
the image and put a text editor window beside it — that way I'm
inspired as I write. GameSpy peeps love to stroll by my desk at this
point to see what's cooking for tomorrow's feature.

{% css_class(class="float-right caption") %}
[![](/img/columns/image/feb04_planetfargo_writing.png)](/img/columns/image/feb04_planetfargo_writingbig.png)  
Having the pic right next to the text editor inspires me.
{% end %}

It takes anywhere from ten minutes to a half hour to write the Victim —
usually because I already have an idea in my head before I start
writing. There's nothing technically exciting about *how* I write the
victim ("Remember kids: always hit the 'enter' key at the end of every
paragraph") so instead I'll talk more generally about the kind of stuff
people ask me in regards to the column.

**Where Do You Get Your Ideas?**

One of the first places I check is [our
mailbag](https://web.archive.org/web/20010201000000/http://feedback.gamespy.com/)
where people are welcome to send in ideas. Occasionally I'll see one
that'll get me going, like [when someone told me the story about the
Naked Guy](@/victim/114.md). In at least one case, the dude
practically wrote up the victim himself — [as was the case with the
Tribes Hand](@/victim/67.md).

But for the most part ideas just come from observing stuff around you.
The reason I started the feature is because the gaming community is just
so frickin' *funny* to begin with. Who hasn't run across [some jerk in
the Diablo forums](@/victim/72.md) or [the guys secretly running a
server against campus policy?](@/victim/77.md) Real people can be
really funny, you just have to spot 'em.

Most of the ideas come from stuff that happens to me. Yes, there really
is [a Matrix action figure sitting on my monitor](@/victim/79.md). He
*does* make me feel badass. [One time I had a terrible
cold](@/victim/87.md), and a victim was the result.

{% css_class(class="float-left caption") %}
![](/img/columns/image/feb04_planetfargo_nopants.png)  
I've never shown up at an important meeting without pants, at least, not when I was sober enough
to remember it.
{% end %}


And so it was with this last victim. I [moved my desk
recently](@/victim/113.md), and encountered a new problem. GameSpy
isn't the best with climate control here, so when the sun sets, the air
conditioner keeps running, and I freeze my wedding tackle off. One night
I was having trouble typing, I was so cold. I tried using a space heater
and with a "pop" I blew a fuse and plunged a whole corner of GameSpy
into darkness (possibly the topic of a future victim?). Some people
would get angry. I got inspired.

So I had some vague idea of a freezing guy for a Victim. In order to get
things focused on gaming, I had the frozen guy's game performance
suffer. It occurred to me that having some guy whine about an air
conditioner wasn't funny, which is why I threw in another character
named Crenshaw, who was doing it on purpose — now, the fact that
someone ELSE is turning on the air conditioner just to win at Quake, now
*that* was funny. Most of my ideas come from real life, then I tweak
them around until they strike me as plausible, but ridiculous. :)  

**How Do I Get Good At Writing?**

{% css_class(class="float-right caption") %}
![](/img/columns/image/feb04_planetfargo_dotcoms.png)  
Tip 54: Make fun of dot.com companies.
{% end %}

**Fargo:** People occasionally hit me with this question in my email. I'm
afraid the advice I have isn't really exciting — just read a lot and
write every day. It's good to be more than a writer, too. You want to
have a lot of background to draw from. The fact that I study history,
know how to program computers and design webpages, and helped build a
start-up company from the ground up gives me a lot of raw material to
work from. Especially now, when [making fun of the dot.com
industry](@/victim/20.md) is so trendy.

True story: I wanted to sharpen my skillz as a writer, so I thought I
would make myself write a short piece every day. Even if it was just a
character sketch. Somehow, when I was working this idea out in my head,
I decided I should write about gamers and actually post the content so
that people could see it. Voila! The Daily Victim was born. But if
you're serious about writing, write something every day, even if you
don't post it anywhere.

**Don't Be Afraid to Go All Weird**

{% css_class(class="float-left caption") %}
![](/img/columns/image/feb04_planetfargo_christmas.png)  
Strange is good.
{% end %}

I think the biggest problem people have when they're writing or doing
any kind of art — the so-called "writer's block" — is because of
self-censorship. Somewhere in the back of their head there's a little
kid coming up with all sorts of cool ideas, and before they can even
think about making it happen, part of their brain says, "No, that's too
Weird." "...too gross." "...too stupid." "...too juvenile." "...will
make you look bad." "...might offend anyone who happens to be friends
with one-legged armenian cab drivers." etc. etc. Sadly, especially here
in the United States, a lot of kids are trained that way from school,
where often it's more important to be like everyone else and turn in
exactly what the teacher asks. Thank God for the few teachers out there
that actually encouraged me to break some rules!

Anyways, don't be afraid to play around with really whacked ideas.
Imagine for a second Steven King sitting in an easy chair brainstorming
ideas for his next novel — you think he's sitting there thinking "too
weird, too weird?" No way! He's running with everything until he finds
an idea he likes. Work with weird things and you can make weird things
work.

That brings us back to the victim we're working on, by the way (and you
thought I was just rambling.) In real life, people rarely spend a
weekend rigging up complex networks of plastic hamster-tubes (which, if
I were president, I'd change immediately.) In the end, it made for a
funny story though — so I ran with it.  

**Different Victims for Different Folks**

{% css_class(class="float-left caption") %}
![](/img/columns/image/feb04_planetfargo_smacktalk.png)  
I really liked this guy, but he scored really low. Ah well.
{% end %}

**Fargo:** Once I have an idea for the Victim there are a few different
ways I can go with it.

The first is what I call the "Character Profile." I take a funny premise
and just sorta flesh out the character around it. [The Beaver-Teeth Tech
Guy](@/victim/10.md), [The Chick Defending the
Flag](@/victim/17.md), [The Guy With the Really Small
Monitor](@/victim/49.md), or [The Wimpy Guy Who Really Wants to Smack
Talk But Isn't Very Good At It](@/victim/50.md). Often I write these
when the concept behind the character is funny enough as is. I really
like these, but they generally only get mediocre scores from you
cretins. (Oh, sorry, I meant that in a nice way. ;)

Then there's the "Story" ones. These take a little longer, because I
actually have to think of a beginning middle and end and wrap it all up
in a few paragraphs. The story about [that guy's calamitous Worms
Armageddon game](@/victim/104.md) is a good example. The story about
[The Kid Who Got a Puppy Instead of Team Arena](@/victim/82.md) is
another classic — one of the highest ranked ever (I think people are
morally opposed to giving cute puppydogs low scores.) In general, the
Victims that actually tell a whole story get ranked WAY higher. All
along people have been saying that nobody wants to *read* on the web,
but I guess it kinda goes to show you that people LOVE stories.

For holiday specials I experimented with doing "Group" victims. These
seem to get really high scores (people love when previous Victims get
together) so I'm going to keep doing them on occasion — the [Christmas
Special](@/victim/80.md) is both a story *and* a group piece and
proves my point about not being afraid to be weird. It's the highest
ranked Victim ever!

Finally there are the "non-traditional" victims. These often come from
Gabe drawing a picture so bizarre I don't know what to do with it. The
[Force Feedback Guy](@/victim/15.md) is weird. One of the best weird
ones is [The Quake Pig.](@/victim/83.md) Go there now and look at the
voting — funniest graph ever! A lot of times these Victims score really
low, but I love throwing them in there. You know. The best part of this
feature is not knowing what you're going to see every day.

In the case of our friend the frozen guy, a character sketch just didn't
seem like enough. I mean, the title basically gave the whole joke away.
I needed to take it a step farther, and the obvious way to do that was
to have him plot revenge against the air conditioner guy. We had
everything a classic story needs: Characters, conflict, and a
resolution. Who da man? Why yes, yes I am.

**Posting the Victim**

{% css_class(class="float-right caption") %}
![](/img/columns/image/feb04_planetfargo_finished.png)  
Voila! The finished product.
{% end %}

We have an admin system where I just cut and paste my story into along
with links to Gabe's images. Because it's a daily feature I couldn't
afford to have it eat away too much of my day so this way basically as
fast as I can write it, it's online.

Then, I watch the scoring. Sometimes I log in at midnight just to watch
it get posted and to see what people think. Usually the first 100 votes
pretty much sum up how everyone will feel. I watch the numbers closely
because it gives me great feedback on what you want to see more of ...
there's also some weird voting psychology there that I don't understand,
which makes it all the more interesting to watch.

I consider anything that scores less than a 7 to be pretty much a loser
for everyone involved. Anything above 8 I consider a success. Anything
that hits a 9 or above is a smash hit — that's a rarity! Soon we'll
have forums hooked up to the victim so you can comment on it.

**Fargo, You're Boring Us**

Sorry. I'm done. [Go check out the Daily Victim!](./)
