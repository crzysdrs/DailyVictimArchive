[![](img/top10/july01/victims/logo.png){: #vicpic}](./)


\[UPDATE: No sooner do I write this list than, just this weekend, a [New
Victim](%ARTICLE[259]%) entered the top 10! It goes to show you how
this feature continually evolves...\]

For nearly a year GameSpy has run a feature that we lovingly call "[The
Daily Victim.](./)" A combined comedic effort from yours truly and
Gabriel from
[Penny-Arcade](http://web.archive.org/web/20010730000000/http://www.penny-arcade.com/),
it's a unique feature -- part comic, part story, part editorial, partly
my fault. It's a daily tribute to the Internet gaming culture and the
characters who inhabit it.

One of the highlights of the feature, though, is the audience
participation. Each day when a new victim is posted, YOU -- our
invincible readers -- rank that victim on a scale of one to ten. The
votes are tabulated and averaged out, giving each victim a score (this
may represent the only time many of them will ever score.) At the end of
the week the highest ranked victims are drawn in full color and are
featured in a special story of some sort. Frequently the victims will
run across one another -- characters you like will have a habit of
appearing and reappearing.

As a result, GameSpy can look at those rankings and compile a
"definitive" Top 10. I say "definitive" inside of "quotes" and make the
"gestures" with my "fingers" because sometimes I just can't understand
WHAT you people were THINKING! Sometimes I'll write what I believe to be
a comedic masterpiece and it'll score an average of six, while a toilet
jokes busts out with a score of 8.5. *What is going on inside your
heads!?* Nonetheless, these rankings aren't fudged. It's literally a
reader's choice of the best of the best.

The Daily Victim feature just got a [New Look](./) and we've just
started offering the first ever [Daily Victim
Tee-Shirt](http://web.archive.org/web/20010730000000/http://www.cafepress.com/cp/store/productdetail.aspx?prodno=1245034),
a limited-edition run that will not be available after August 6th. In
honor of both progress and rampant, unchecked capitalism we present: The
Top Ten Victims of All Time! As voted by our readers. With my own
comments included. Plus trivia. On with the list!

\[Click on the pics to go to that Victim!\]

**10. [The Daily Victim Easter Special](%ARTICLE[171]%)**

[![](img/top10/july01/victims/10.png)](%ARTICLE[171]%)

  
 This Victim immediately scored high on the richter scale because it
contains the infamous [Gaming Gigabuys Guy](%ARTICLE[106]%), one of
the most hardcore of victims ever. He's mean, foul-mouthed, usually
dressed as a fluffy animal, and hates his life. As a result he's a blast
to torture (someday this dude has to get his own Tee-shirt). In this
case he was the victim of an unfortunate incident involving [the retail
release of Tribes 2 and a Monkey](%ARTICLE[160]%). I always love
when Victims can run across one another, so making the poor guy hand out
easter eggs seemed like the perfect excuse to bring back dudes like [The
Unix Admin Wizard](%ARTICLE[119]%), another personal favorite. The
unexpected Matrix-twist ending really brings this puppy home -- I'm glad
this made the top ten. I think if I hadn't gone on Vacation he woulda
been on the Top 5 ... you creeps tend to start ranking victims lower and
lower if they're online for more than a day or so!

The Gaming Gigabuys guy also had a cameo during the [Daily Victim E3
Week](%ARTICLE[203]%) that was pretty funny.

**9. [Arch Nemesis In A Body Cast](%ARTICLE[211]%)**

[![](img/top10/july01/victims/9.png)](%ARTICLE[211]%)

  
 I was surprised that the color version of this victim did better than
[the black and white version](%ARTICLE[205]%) -- in that one, I
introduced "Stewie the Frosh," a hardcore deathmatcher who was willing
to break his own arm in order to even the odds with the victim pictured
above. It had that kinda Quentin Tarantino-esque "savor the moment
before the violence so your audience is cringing" kinda thing. When it
came time to do a color version of him, I thought, *how was I gonna top
that?*

The result was this guy, number 9 on our list. It's the most morbid and
gruesome Daily Victim EVER. But the black comedy somehow seems to work,
especially when the guy flatlines in the hospital. The one-upsmanship is
totally unrealistic -- or is it? I mean, come on, *I* know
super-competitive people like that, so the story is ridiculous but it's
still based around human traits. I think that's why people liked this
victim. Alternatively, maybe you're just a bunch of SICK BASTARDS.
Either way.

**8. [The Server Admin Who Torments People on His Unreal
Server](%ARTICLE[143]%)**

[![](img/top10/july01/victims/8.png)](%ARTICLE[143]%)

  
 Sometimes I have a lot of trouble coming up with a color version of a
victim that I felt was a "one-shot." But, people loved [this
guy](%ARTICLE[135]%), who after running the most reliable server on
the net for a couple years, decides to tweak all his server settings in
order to mess with peoples' heads.

For the color version, I stared at his picture for a long time before I
decided that the only way to take him to the next level was to show
people reacting to the havoc he creates. I brought out the all-stars:
The [Overclocker](%ARTICLE[34]%), the [Unix
Wizard](%ARTICLE[119]%), and even [The Guy Who Hates His
ISP](%ARTICLE[52]%). Maybe people just love to vote high when the
characters they like appear. Regardless, I managed to squeeze a lot more
laughs out of this guy than I thought I could.

Trivia: [Madame Rochquet](%ARTICLE[139]%), the fortune teller who
can read gibs, foretold this whole storyline. Creeeepy...

**7. [Tribes 2 Suicide Pilot Meets His Arch
Nemesis](%ARTICLE[253]%)**

[![](img/top10/july01/victims/7.png)](%ARTICLE[253]%)

  
 People seem to respond better when I trigger in on games they know and
love, so [I've](%ARTICLE[246]%) [written](%ARTICLE[244]%)
[a](%ARTICLE[229]%) [lot](%ARTICLE[221]%)
[of](%ARTICLE[218]%) [Tribes](%ARTICLE[185]%)
[2](%ARTICLE[183]%) [victims](%ARTICLE[182]%). Mind you, I like
*Tribes 2* but I don't play it that often. In fact ... I suck. I'd
rather fire up [Codename Eagle](%ARTICLE[251]%), where I am a small
well-dressed God. But occasionally I'll fire up the game and dream about
what it would be like if I was the Mastah. [The Tribes 2 Suicide
Pilot](%ARTICLE[244]%) was just such a character.

I always think it's funny to mix real-life with game-conventions in
order to show why the game conventions are ludicrous. For instance, in a
real war, you don't respawn. So making a "suicide run" has a lot of
heavy connotations -- like the infamous Kamakazi pilots of World War II.
But in the game-world, being a suicider can be a career decision.

Take that same character to the extreme and you get victim number 7
here. The best line is "I was gonna kill that bastard even if I lived
trying!" Another thing I love to do is mix dumb-ass jokes with highbrow
humor, like they used to do with *Mystery Science Theatre 3000*. "I
realized that I was just the Salieri of suicide ... and I had just met
my Mozart." How many people are actually gonna *get* that!? Who cares?
Anyways, this is the most recent victim to enter the top 10, which made
me happy, since readers have had a lot more discriminating tastes
recently.

**6. [Kid Who Got a Puppy for Christmas ... Instead of Quake
3](%ARTICLE[82]%)**

[![](img/top10/july01/victims/6.png)](%ARTICLE[82]%)

  
 This Victim generated a lot of email from us, including a bunch from
girls. That's good advice, folks: You want to get chicks? Write about
kids and puppies. Anyways, occasionally I write a Victim that's a funny
(or even serious) story instead of just "a gag." This victim wasn't
laugh-out-loud funny but it was a cool story. I channeled every
childhood Christmas I ever had along with fond memories of our family
dog, Charlie Brown, into this story and I think people could relate.
This Victim stayed in the top five for quite a while.

Puppy-kid has [a sequel](%ARTICLE[95]%) that's kinda cute, but
didn't quite have the same oomph.

**5. [The Frozen Air-Conditioning Guy](%ARTICLE[123]%)**

[![](img/top10/july01/victims/5.png)](%ARTICLE[123]%)

  
 Now we're busting into the top five with the air conditioning guy. It's
based off the idea that someone in his office would crank up the air
conditioning in order to freeze his deathmatch opponents. (I came up
with the idea trying to play Half-Life while freezing my butt off.) Now,
in real life, the joke would end there: he'd be found out. But in the
world of the Victims, nothing ends until it ends *funny.* So our victim
tries to turn the tables using (I love this phrase) "a complex network
of hamster-tubing."

What really makes this victim stand out is that he's one of the many to
feature one of the best cameo characters of the bunch: Crenshaw. We've
never actually *seen* Crenshaw. We know he's the type of guy to [use
other peoples' computers for gaming](%ARTICLE[70]%) when they're out
of the office, or to [tell his son that the gaze of a piggy-bank could
turn a man to stone](%ARTICLE[215]%). He's a troublemaker, Crenshaw.
And along with [The Hippie Gamer Ed](%ARTICLE[181]%) he's one of
those characters who's totally fleshed out even though he never appears.

Trivia: My absolute *favorite* Crenshaw cameo was the [Salmon Jerky
Episode](%ARTICLE[175]%). He appears near the end in a brief scene
that, even today, makes me laugh out loud when I get to it. I wish the
Salmon Jerky guy had scored higher.

**4. [Low Ping Superhero Does Battle With Forces of
Overclocking](%ARTICLE[194]%)**

[![](img/top10/july01/victims/4.png)](%ARTICLE[194]%)

  
 I couldn't figure out why this Victim scored so high. I thought the
[original Superhero Victim](%ARTICLE[186]%) was pretty funny, but
after I wrote this color version I thought, "This is gonna be a dud."
But people loved it! Maybe it was the cheesy comic-book-parody plot.
Maybe it was that it was so ridiculously over the top it just deserved
praise. Maybe people just loved seeing [The Overclocking
Kid](%ARTICLE[34]%) return.

Trivia: I think the overclocking kid has made more cameos in other
victims than any other character. He's just so easy to work into any
plot. While he's no longer in the Top 10, he will forever be
immortalized by [his inaugural appearance](%ARTICLE[13]%) when he
declared, "I'm capable of over 360 separate erections a minute. WHO'S
LAUGHING NOW, University of Iowa?"

**3. [The Unix Administration Wizard](%ARTICLE[119]%)**

[![](img/top10/july01/victims/3.png)](%ARTICLE[119]%)

  
 I'm totally thrilled that this guy is in the top 3. I used to do a
little Unix programming back in college, and I soon discovered that,
with Unix, the more you know ... the more you realize there is to know.
Running a Unix server is a lot like keeping a car running with parts
that you've built and/or selected yourself by hand. Unix people will
argue for hours about the best way to run their "cars." If you ever
overhear them, it's crazy. It's a lot like listening to a wizard speak
about arcane powers in a foreign language ... hence: [The Unix Admin Was
Born](%ARTICLE[109]%) in [This Victim](%ARTICLE[109]%).

Of course, the original character was a one-off gag, and not a lot of
people "got" it. Fortunately (I think 'cuz the Slashdot people boosted
him up) he scored good enough to get a special weekend edition. This
time [he really came to life](%ARTICLE[119]%), busting almost into
the number one position. He found himself locked in a battle of wits
with [an abusive chess player](%ARTICLE[117]%), then had to argue
with his RPG gaming boss who's [business plan](%ARTICLE[110]%) is,
in my opinion, the model of a modern company. Never mind that it's clear
from the pictures that the Chess guy is going to kick his ass; The Unix
Wizard, like the Gaming Gigabuys Guy, is constantly being tortured by
circumstance. Long live da wiz!

**2. [The Daily Victim Christmas Special](%ARTICLE[80]%)**

[![](img/top10/july01/victims/2.png)](%ARTICLE[80]%)

  
 For most of the year, this victim was in the number one slot. The first
time I ever combined several victims into one big story was for the
[Daily Victim Thanksgiving Special](%ARTICLE[56]%), and it went over
really well. But it was here that I really figured out the form. All the
color victims to date combined into one totally twisted, completely
unpredictable story. The way they all end up interacting is totally
surreal. It's like the antithesis of a holiday special, with exploding
toilets, Santas with dynamite, guys with swords, you name it. This was a
tough victim to write (you shoulda seen my notes!) but it really came
together. The only problem is, how can I top it *this* year?

Trivia: [The Flag Defending Chick](%ARTICLE[38]%), who has a great
part in the Christmas Special, was one of the most popular early
victims. She generated a lot of emails and appeared in a lot of reader
submissions ("and then the dude should meet the chick with the
penguin...") As a result, she's featured on [The First Ever Daily Victim
Limited-Edition
Shirt](http://web.archive.org/web/20010730000000/http://www.cafepress.com/cp/store/productdetail.aspx?prodno=1245034).
WHY does she have a penguin? I always thought it was more funny if it
simply wasn't explained. Gabe (the illustrator) throws me curveballs
like that. Somehow it's endearing that she's always screaming whatever
she has to say at this poor (possibly frightened) bird.

**And the number one Victim of all time is....**

**1. [Creeping Horror at Palace Park Amusements](%ARTICLE[190]%)**

[![](img/top10/july01/victims/1.gif)](%ARTICLE[190]%)

  
 Certainly the best Daily Victim to date, this is also one of the best
pieces of fiction I've ever written. [read this one](%ARTICLE[190]%)
in a darkened room, friends! It's not really the humor so much as the
horror that marks this one, which was good enough to be linked to from
several big news sites. After this victim scored a whopping *9.23* in
the voting, the ranks for the rest of the victims were never the same.
People started getting REALLY stingy with the "10" votes because every
other victim was compared to this guy, and I started to see a lot more
"8s" and "9s."

Believe it or not, this Victim is almost based on a true story. GameSpy
came across an old *Pole Position II* arcade machine once and snapped it
up, so it sits in our lobby. I was among the best players in the office
(nobody could bust on the Suzuka track like ME.) One night I was working
late -- alone in the office -- when I heard a screeching noise coming
from the machine. I padded softly over to it and saw it displaying
garbledegook and making weird noises. Let's be frank: It scared the
*crap* out of me. But I went back to my desk and emailed a rough outline
of this story to Gabriel so he could illustrate it right away. It's
really the masterpiece of the Daily Victim series; I'm glad readers like
you liked it as much as I did.

I decided not to make a color version of this guy, breaking the rules.
What's funny is, a lot of people at GameSpy and several readers wrote in
to say "Leave this one alone!" It was so good as it was, a sequel would
just sorta take away from the original. I totally agree. Someday, he
*might* come back ... we'll just have to see, won't we?

Trivia: There really *is* a Palace Park Amusements in Irvine,
California. It's appeared in several victims so far and remains one of
the only video arcades I still visit with any regularity.

UPDATE! Yeah, a few days after I finished writing this, the [Grand
Turismo Grand Finale](%ARTICLE[259]%) victim entered into the top
ten! Sitting for two days at number one it's edged its way down to the
number 2 slot. Ruining my whole top 10 list! Oh well.

**My Personal Favorites**

I couldn't resist the opportunity to list my personal favorites here.
Sometimes I write up a victim and I think it's the greatest thing since
sliced bread -- when I come in the next morning I find that my readers
torched the poor guy. (Of course, the reverse is when I write something
I don't really like but it turns out to strike a chord.) So here's a few
of my favs that you won't find on the top 20:

-   [The Coin Operated Servers](%ARTICLE[215]%): Another great
    Crenshaw cameo! Start with the premise of coin-operated web servers
    and take it to a ridiculous extreme. I wish this one could've been
    an animated cartoon.
-   ["Only the Innocents Remain!"](%ARTICLE[191]%): Mostly it's just
    the headline of this victim that cracks me up.
-   [Becoming Young Again](%ARTICLE[235]%): This is the most
    *surreal* victim ever. A whacked story about two guys desperate to
    get their Atari 2600 working. This one's better if you went to
    gradeschool in the 80s.
-   [Eating a Hot Dog During the Loading Screen:](%ARTICLE[222]%)
    This one just builds and builds and builds until the climax is way
    better than the setup would lead you to believe. Still a
    personal favorite.
-   [The Guy Who Can't Quite Trash Talk](%ARTICLE[50]%): This dude
    is hysterical. It's like he wants to lay down the SmaQ, but can't
    quite ... do it right.
-   [Pimp Game Developer Speaks Out](%ARTICLE[204]%): I thought this
    was a masterpiece of a story with a really cool ending. But maybe
    most people couldn't get past the way the main character talked. I
    thought it was one of the best Victims ever, probably in my personal
    top ten.
-   [The Guy and the Koala](%ARTICLE[20]%): *I* think this one's
    a riot. It's one of the very first. I think it's mostly the look on
    the guy's face ... and the way the copy reads, how he's so CLEARLY
    pissed but he's restraining himself and trying to be civil. Yet the
    animosity creeps out between the lines. Man, this one's great. I had
    high hopes for him.

That should do 'er. As always, check out [The Daily Victim](./) every
day! This week happens to be *Gran Turismo 3* week. If you like the
feature, support it by [snagging a
Tee-shirt](http://web.archive.org/web/20010730000000/http://www.cafepress.com/cp/store/productdetail.aspx?prodno=1245034).
Every so often a new one will be available, and the old designs will
never be sold ever again. Enjoy!
