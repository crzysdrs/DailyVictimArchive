The astute among you will note that I'm still here, with a larger
clipboard and an even larger chip on my shoulder. That's right. The
[search for a new artist](%ARTICLE[298]%) continues. I'd like to
offer some words of advice having looked over the first batch of
applicants:

1. If I need to verify that I am over 18 in order to view your
portfolio, which costs $3.95 for unlimited axxxcess, chances are you are
overqualified for this position.

2. If you paint in oils, and each of your masterpieces takes a year to
create, you may be unsuitable for illustrating a daily feature.

3. MSPaint is indeed a versitile tool, but it is often the hallmark of
someone who has yet to reach his or her artistic prime. Which reminds
me:

4. Arms and legs, represented as sticks, lack the 'depth' we look for in
Daily Victim characters.

5. While we appreciate the effort, you need not apply if you can only
draw ninjas. We gave some serious consideration to an "all-ninja" Daily
Victim feature, and decided that it would only serve as a pale imitation
of *Big Trouble in Little China,* but without Kurt Russel's riveting
performance to carry it to greatness. Thanks, but no thanks.

That being said, [Keep those submissions
coming!](mailto:fargo@gamespy.com) Simply send in a link to your online
portfolio. Many of the submissions so far have not made me weep, and I
mean that.
