  site ... but at what cost?

If you know the right places to look, you can still find online services
where you can buy and sell *EverQuest* characters. Yeah, yah, I know
it's against the [end-user license agreement](%ARTICLE[63]%), but
c'mon, do I look like the kind of guy who has two years to dedicate to
the game? No, I just wanted a high-level character, quick and easy.

After shopping around I found a tempting offer for a level 43 barbarian.
The price was right, but the ad was a little funny. Under "Price" it
listed the following: "$75 U.S. Dollars + One Unimpeded Shot to the
Nards. Hard." There were no shipping costs, since the ad requested that
both the game character and the shot to the nards would be delivered in
person.

Well, hey, a prudent shopper can see what a deal that was. It's not like
he was [asking for a human baby](%ARTICLE[54]%). So, I bid on the
auction and won. We talked on the phone and arranged a time for
delivery. I didn't think it would be that bad -- anyone who spends so
much time in front of the PC to build up an *EQ* character couldn't be
all that buff, right?

Yesterday was the big day. The seller drove up in a growling rusted
Pontiac GTO that rumbled angrily to a halt in front of my mailbox. Two
guys got out, both of which were easily the size of mobile homes. They
wore leather, chains, and dark glasses. In a meaty gloved hand the one
guy carried a boxed copy of EverQuest as well as print-outs of all his
character registration information and passwords.

Before I could really think it through, I found myself handing him the
check. I mean, it *was* a level 43 character. You got to make sacrifices
to get a character that good, right? Then the seller cracked his
knuckles, planted his feet, and took in a deep growling breath like a
sumo wrestler. Veins popped out on either side of his grizzled face.

His foot hit my crotch like a jackhammer. I swear to God I was actually
lifted up from the ground. I hit the grass, crumpling back to the earth
like a ragdoll, the pain so intense that the sky above me had become a
dark purple blur. The guy I bought the barbarian from dropped the
character to the ground next to me and turned to leave.

As he walked off, I heard him say to his buddy: "Man, you're right. That
*was* worth six months and a marriage."
