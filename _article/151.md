Whasup bro?

Things cool, things cool. 'Cept for THE MAN comin' down on my band. Oh
no, not "Apoplectic Marios," we broke up on Wednesday. No dude, new
band, "The Frogger Gods," we got hooked up with this new [Lead
Singer](%ARTICLE[136]%) who does a killer riff on the Deus Ex theme,
and this other [mofo named -=Roachman=-](%ARTICLE[128]%) who rips it
up with the lyrics. Yeah, we were jammin in his garage last night and he
just busts out with, "My mouse works it optically / lays it on thickly,
quickly / uh hunh uh hunh." You know hooks like that sell.

So last night me and Denny were on Napster, you know, trying to score a
copy of the old "exSay istolsPay," you know how it is, and Denny says
let's like upload some of our stuff. I says, werd. So we put our songs
up there and gave 'em names like, "Anna Kournikova brings Britney Spears
to Orgasm" and for eight straight hours we were the number one band on
the Internet.

We're chillin' this morning, you know, thinking of what we're gonna call
our next song, and then the Fed Ex truck pulls up and we think it's like
BAM, you know, record contract. Like tonight I was gonna have my head
out the roof of the limo and no pants on dig? But no, it's a cease and
desist from Hasbro, 'cuz they like got "Frogger" trademarked.

That shit ain't right. Jimmy, the dude with the Deus Ex lips, says two
years ago he was in this classic games tournament at Palace Park
Amusements in Irvine and took the Frogger high score, so like, he IS a
Frogger God. They can't be takin' that away from him. F the man, you
know what I'm sayin'? F the man.
