[My mom gets more abuse on that frickin' Tribes
server](%ARTICLE[21]%) than she did when she was still married to
dad!

Last night was the worst. So there I was, accidently defending an enemy
command point. Cut me some slack. The point is, on the enemy team there
was this heavy armor named "\[DHead\]Tony\_A." So you know, I pull out
my best line, "R U a chick?" And she says, "Yes I am, meatstud."

MeatStud! I'm scorin' big, you know? So right away I put down the can of
hairspray I was sniffin' so I could keep a clear head, and I tell my
roommate who just walked in that I was gonna make it with this Tonya
chick.

Now my roomate is a total joke, right? He's only a couple of years older
than me, it just seems like more since I've been in high school for
almost eight years. He acts all big because he has a real job instead of
my minimum-wage part-time deal at the paint factory, but the truth is,
he just plays Asheron's Call all day at work, and he even brags about
it. He doesn't even *play* Tribes, but he logs into the server anyway to
meet my honey.

"Hey Tony!" he says. "If you think MeatStud is hot, wait 'til you meet
his mom!"

At this point, my whole team just starts pilin' it on. My momma did
this, they say, my momma did that. I'll say it before, and I will say it
again: when my mom blocked off the entrance to the supermarket for an
hour that one time it was *not* cuz her ass was so big she got wedged in
the automatic doors, and they did *not* use the jaws of life to pull her
butt out. She simply had a seizure 'cuz she forgot to take her methadone
and they were afraid to move the body, okay? And another thing, my momma
and I never "got it on," she stopped doing that kind of thing way before
I was born.

But anyways, after that, Tonya was totally not into getting it on with
me anymore. She just kept asking about my mom. All thanks to my
roommate, who even offered to sell tickets if my mom and Tonya got it on
-- nice one, dillsmack.
