  Now that we've got that taken care of, let's talk about your 3D card. You bought
  it from the sock rack at K-Mart. It came with a pair of BVDs.

Jimmy, Jimmy, let's talk.

It's not your service provider. You use the same ISP as me. And we're
neighbors. And other than the time [that dude attacked 'em with a
sword](%ARTICLE[46]%) the service has been solid.

The trouble, Jimmy, is your modem. You bought it from the Girl Scouts.
It's a Girl Scout Modem, Jimmy. They were sellin' cookies and modems
door to door, and you, my friend, made the wrong choice.

I'm not trying to begrudge the Girl Scouts anything. In fact, I'm
pleased that the young girls of America are learning the technical
skills that will benefit them as adults. Also, hopefully, many of them
will grow up and buy webcams. But I digress.

My point is? Mint Thins, yes. Modems? No! Look Jimmy, your hardware came
inside of a Caramel DeLites box, for the love of all that's holy. [It
smells like coconuts.](%ARTICLE[60]%)

You and me, Jimmy, we're gonna march down to the mall and buy us a nice
shiney new 56K modem, at least. Maybe you should get a cable modem. They
sell the service from an ice cream truck now, you know.
