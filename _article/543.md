title: But sir, Battle.net’s policy about disconnects makes no exceptions if your
  house blows up. It’s in the EULA.

Sir I’ve been doing tech support for Blizzard for over a year now. I
know that End-User-License-Agreement inside and out. Yah, yah, I know,
it’s a huge unwieldy document ... believe me, I know that nobody reads
it before they start playing ... calm down, sir. I can understand that
you’re frustrated because [your house blew up in the middle of a
critical game](%ARTICLE[542]%), but I can’t go back and adjust your
Battle.net rankings. It’ll count as a disconnect and show up on your
permanent record.

Okay, fine, I’ll show you. Call up the EULA right now from the web site
... oh ... right I forgot, your house has been blown up. Okay, next time
you’re online, look up the license agreement. It’s right underneath the
paragraph about dismemberment and right before the part entitled
“Article VII: An attack from a mass of Sorceresses totally sucks ass and
anyone who does it is a total jerkoff.” Right above that there’s a whole
paragraph about what we do if your house blows up during play. You’d be
surprised how often we deal with that.

Well, actually, I guess there *is* one way to make an exception. If we
can get an email from the account of [the guy you were playing
against](%ARTICLE[536]%) stating that he wishes the game to be
stricken from the records, then I can remove the results. Hah hah! Like
*that’s* ever going to happen, you whining loser.

Oh, wait, did I uh ... I said that aloud and forgot to put you on hold,
didn’t I? Aherm, yah, it’s been a long day.
