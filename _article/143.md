  Oh no, hang on, my server just went down. Oh. Crap, I was having a BLAST. Ah well,
  I'll just go on the newsgroup and blame it on those "hackers" that don't exist,
  and meanwhile I'll re-code the sniper rifle to electrocute its own user.

Hang on, I need a breather, my sides hurt. This is *killing* me! I had
no idea I could maintain the charade for so long. Last week I [set up my
Unreal Tournament server to mess with their heads](%ARTICLE[135]%)
and, after a whole year of total stability, everyone refused to believe
that I had done it on purpose. They would type "WTF?" as the wind
machines would randomly throw their own flak at them and the body armor
they put on would occasionally magnetize and stick them to the walls.
And then I would type into the console, "Gee guys, I dunno what's going
on!" You shoulda seen the looks on their faces!

Wait, hang on, it gets better. So, rumors start to spread on the
newsgroups that someone *hacked* my server. Then, of course, people
started rallying against the "cheaters" who were "ruining" the game! In
the process, of course, my server became the most popular on the net.
Sorta like people driving past the scene of an accident, or the guy who
insists that you taste the milk that went sour. And I'd watch them try
to play, and those chumps would yell in frustration as they shot shock
rifle beams out of their butt, and then I'd push the "fill the level
with acid" button and they's all be screaming and dying. "Oh no!" I'd
type. "There's that pesky *hacker* again!"

I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY'RE BUYING THIS! I could do this for years! Nothing
can stop me! Hahahahah!!

[![](img/victimpics/colorwizard.jpg)](%ARTICLE[119]%){: .left}**AT LAST, AT
THE END OF A LONG AND WEARY DAY, I SHALL PUT MY MIND AT REST WITH A
RELAXING GAME OF UNREAL TOURNAMENT ON MY FAVORITE, AND MOST RELIABLE,
SERVER**  
 Yes, yes, it hath been a good day indeed. I have finally gotten all of
our servers restored to their 100% open-sourced serving splendor after
that [hideous chess debacle](%ARTICLE[119]%) of some weeks back that
brought our whole system to its knees. I shall now unwind with a
refreshing game of Unreal Tournament, a rare treat for mine senses and
an opportune time to relax my overtaxed brain. Ah yes, I shall load up
GameSpy and click on my most favored of hunting grounds, a server I have
trusted for nearly a year. Hmm. What have we? I'm firing my shock rifle
and nothing is happening, although I hear the noise. What's this? Mine
teammates are dead and broken behind me! Here now, I seem to be attached
to the wall. Wait, the level, it fills with slime! OH IGNOMINIOUS
DEFEAT! Wherefore has my server gone!? This cannot stand to pass! NO ONE
DAREST PUBLICLY MOCK MINE UNREAL TOURNAMENTATIONS!

I shall put a stop to this miscreant server operator. See here now, I
dual boot into Linux. Ah, heavenly scripting. Traceroutable glory. See
here, here hmmm -- why, this reprobate runs his machiavellian hijynxs
through *my* ISP! Thus making me an accomplice in his nefarious
villainy! Hah, but that fool fails to realize I've coded back doors into
every user account. I shall merely hack into his machine and restore his
server to its unmolested state, that I and others may enjoy the fruit of
Unreal Tournament in its virgin glory. Ah yes. Hack, hack, mine nimble
fingers. None shall outwit me.

[![](img/victimpics/colorappliances.gif)](%ARTICLE[34]%){: .left}**ACCORDING
TO THE NEWSGROUPS SOMEONE IS DESTROYING MY FAVORITE UNREAL TOURNAMENT
SERVER**  
 Hello slowping! Do you see what has happened to my favorite server?
After 344 days of flawless continuity, suddenly it's set up so that
whirling blades come down randomly from the ceiling and slaughter us
all. It is [just as Madame Rochquet foretold!](%ARTICLE[139]%) I see
on the newsgroups that a *hacker* is responsible, and if you're smart
like I am you know by now to believe everything you see posted. As [the
master of overclocking](%ARTICLE[34]%), nobody is better-equipped to
end this fool's reign of terror! Watch as I telnet, now I am trying
random passwords at an astonishing rate, ah! I'm in! Here is the server,
and yes, look, there's somebody who just gave themselves admin access
from a remote IP address. I have you now, hacker! Hand me the floppy
disk with that virus I've spent the last 18 man-years coding at the
assembly level... I'll bring this fool's entire network crashing around
his head! This virus will utterly destroy him!

[![](img/victimpics/colorwoeisp.gif)](%ARTICLE[52]%){: .left}**WHAT!?! MY ISP
IS DOWN *AGAIN*?**  
 This is ridiculous! Here [I had finally made peace with my
ISP](%ARTICLE[80]%) and lo! Again, down it goes, down into the pit
of hopelessless and forever without the conforting glow of the green
blinky lights on my DSL modem. How does this stuff happen? And the
timing couldn't have been worse, I was just about to log into my new
favorite Unreal Tourney server, the one running the new mod wherein I
can smite the unbelievers by shooting the shock rifle out of my hiney.
The time for forgiveness has past; the meek shall now inherit. REPENT,
ISP! I am coming again, and this time we finish it! Hand me my
broadsword, desciple, the crusade begins anew.
