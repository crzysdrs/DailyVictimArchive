Okay, to be fair, I can't claim that this solid two-pound brick of
Velveeta cheese is the only edible thing in the house. I did a thorough
search and made a list in between games of F-Zero. Here goes:

We have one solid, untouched brick of Velveeta Cheese. We have one bag
of microwave popcorn (though the microwave hasn't worked since I paid
Joey five bucks to put a dozen eggs in there). We have half a package of
Lipton Cup-A-Soup I discovered between [Charlie's](%ARTICLE[207]%)
mattresses. There are enough broken ramen noodles on the second shelf of
the pantry that, when scraped together, may comprise of an entire
package's worth (minues the flavoring.) We have one small can of what I
believe is tuna, although the label peeled off after the flood. We have
a third of a bottle of ketchup and half a case of Moose Head beer. I was
excited earlier to find almost a full cupful of frozen peas in the
freezer but later it was dertermined that they were not, after all,
peas. We also have a full tube of toothpaste -- not sure of its
nutritional value.

Well, roommates, as I see it the Velveeta brick is clearly going to be
our "staple" food. We're just gonna have to, as they say, 'go for it.'

So who's first? C'mon Stan. I figure we each take a bite and pass it
around, then wrap the rest up for lunch tommorow. Just do it. It goes
down easier if you just go for it in one big gulp. Okay, fine, go
hungry. Joey, you're up. You want some ketchup? Maybe beer for a chaser?
ATTABOY! Now quick, hand it here, I'm starved.
