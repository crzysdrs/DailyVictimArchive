Hold it! Hold it! Everybody can’t chat all at once or I can’t read the
screen. I have the floor. Ahem. Yes, all of us thought that [faking a
dragon-slaying](%ARTICLE[566]%) was a good idea for our guild, but
[things just didn’t pan out](%ARTICLE[567]%). So all I’m saying is,
it’s in our best interest to fake our own death until the heat blows
over.

Wow, I can’t believe what I’m hearing. You guys don’t want to fake your
own deaths? C’mon, I do it all the time. What? For crying out loud,
BainDramage, I can’t believe YOU of all people are against this. You
were first in line offering to Photoshop-up the fake dragon-killin’. And
Bloodsaage? Where’s the love? Who had a room full of illegal Guatemalans
powerlevel you up to level 50 while you slept? That’s right, I did. Show
a little respect.

All right then, let’s put this to vote! All in favor of our *EverQuest*
guild, Archon’s Minions, faking its own death in a grisly media
spectacular, say Aye!

\[A bunch of people type ‘aye.’\]

“All opposed?”

\[Several people type ‘nay!’\]

Okay, everyone who said Aye, player-kill everyone who said Nay!

\[Ten minutes of furious combat follow, fireballs and ice bolts
exploding all up and down the chamber, swords clashing, shields
buckling, fighters screaming...\]

Excellent, excellent. Ladies, gentlemen, and indiscriminate piles of
smoldering, gutted human remains! We are already halfway there.
BainDramage, take some screenshots of the carnage and post in the forums
that we were jumped by a bunch of Korean Powergamers.

Next up, we’ll stage a motorcade...
