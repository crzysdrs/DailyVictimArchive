Look, okay, check this. The large-ish lever here, if you push down on
it, then it controls the angle of recline. *BUT* if you *twist* that
very same lever, it'll raise or lower the "lumbar support." I don't know
what the hell a "Lumbar" is, but if I so much as *bump* that lever, some
sorta anvil or something rams into my back.

Someone's gonna get hurt!

This lever here, it folds out, and you can turn it like a crank. It took
me almost an hour to figure that out. What does it do? Go ahead, turn
it. Turn the lever all you want. See? Nothing! It apparently does
nothing. There is no visible change to the chair, its angles, its
springiness, or its contours. And yet, yesterday, I was turning that
crank for about an hour, when I suddenly got an ICQ from Debbie down in
accounting that said "Stop that."

So this large paddle-shaped lever right here, it's at the right height
to press down on it with your foot. But *can* you press down on it? No,
you can't! It doesn't move down. However, if you were to accidentally
roll over top of one of the stray [golfballs](%ARTICLE[78]%) we have
rolling around the office, you'd discover that it's possible to push the
lever *up*, which causes the chair to emit a loud noise not unlike a
hydraulic pump, and moments later the back of the chair will suddenly
drop completely parallel with the ground.

That happened to me last Wednesday, and I went immediately and
hopelessly prone. In desperation I tried to press down on the lever to
adjust the angle of recline, but because of my new angle, I twisted it
and got the anvil-to-the-back treatment. In a frantic effort to assuage
the pain I grabbed the large orange ripcord with the warning label on
it, pulling it with all my might. That's when the fire alarm started
ringing. Then all five wheels popped off just before the back of the
chair shot forward with enough momentum to fling me headfirst into the
receptionist cabinet.

Fine, fine, don't believe me. But Tim across the hall? He had a chair
just like this one. And he's been missing for over a week...
