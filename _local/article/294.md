I have moral issues with the game [*Black and
White*](http://web.archive.org/web/20010907000000/http://www.planetblackandwhite.com/),
where you attempt to woo villages with your Godhood and raise an
enormous pet in your image. When I think of the game I recall only a
series of bugs and tedium. However, thanks to my piss-poor job as a DSL
technical support operator, I can only afford one PC game a year, and
this one was it. Amidst this strife and suffering, there was but one
thing that kept me going: My pet *Black and White* Cow, Moomoo.

Oh sweet Moomoo! I raised her lovingly in my benevolent arms -- er --
hand icon. My hope was, in a world riddled with bugs and frustrating
control schemes, that Moomoo would be my shining ray of goodness. I
trained her well. I showed her the light. I showed her how to live and
love and care and snuggle. Each day I showed up to work, booted up
*Black and White* as I turned on my telephone, and Moomoo provided a ray
of sunshine into my dreary cubicle-world.

Then one day I forgot to hit "pause" as I went to get a sandwich. I
returned to find Moomoo randomly uprooting trees and lacksidaisicly
tossing them toward the village. "Bad Moomoo!" I scolded, gently
thwacking her across the face. She hung her head in shame. I thought
lessons had been learned, and goodness would return to the land. But
Moomoo ... reared in love ... she never recovered from the slappage.

She began shuffling about, moping. She started kicking things idly when
I wasn't looking. I was losing my baby! One day I turned my back for a
moment to answer the phone. When I looked up at my monitor, I witnessed
the horror.

[![](img/victimpics/scissors.gif)](%ARTICLE[271]%){: .left}**HELLO, TECHNICAL
SUPPORT? PLEASE, PLEASE HELP ME. IN A FIT OF RAGE I SEEM TO HAVE ...
CLIPPED MY CONNECTION! I NEED MY INTERNET BACK!**

*"You've reached InterNetnet DSL. This call may be monitored for quality
assurance purposes. Now, this is for a residential account?"*

Yes! Yes, I cut my connection! I have no email! No ICQ! No web! Nothing!

*"Hang on a moment ... what? Wait -- WHAT?*

...I cut my connection. What can I do?

*"YOU JUST SHAT ON THE VILLAGE SQUARE YOU MISERABLE RAT-FACED
CLOVEN-HOOFED TURD!"*

Oh please don't be mad at me -- I'm really sorry, I didn't know it was
going to be this big of a deal...

*"You son of a bitch! After all I've done for you!"*

I know, your service has been so good. I'm sorry! I really, really am.

*"I'll beat you! I will SLAP YOUR ASS SO HARD YOUR LITTLE BRAYING HEAD
WILL SPIN!"* \[Sounds of beating and frantic pained mooing are heard.\]

\[Weeping\] Please, please stop! I didn't mean to do it! ...what are you
doing?

\[The furious beating of a cow is audible over the screams and mooing\]

No ... no don't hurt the animals! I didn't mean it. I was mad at my
roommate playing *Day of Defeat* instead of cleaning the fridge and--

*"You were my SUNSHINE?! Do you know that? You were my SUNSHINE and now
you're a miserable flailing FAILURE! I disown you!"*

I ... I didn't realize you'd take it so personally. I'm SO SORRY! I'll
never cut my DSL again! Sign me up for a five year contract -- no, ten
years! Just please forgive me!

*"No, no, this can't go on. We're through, you mangy animal! Through."*
\[Tech support hangs up, weeping.\]
