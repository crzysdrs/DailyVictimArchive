So, it seems that the guys in the apartment below mine [used delicious
barbecue as an excuse to steal my *Morrowind* CD](%ARTICLE[363]%).
Never mind that I already nearly speared one of them in the eye. Let me
tell you, the kid gloves are coming off. I didn't forswear food and
sleep for the last 48 consecutive hours playing the game without
learning a few valuable skillz.

The sun was beginning its descent and drew long slats of light across
the stairwell. Hunched like a Khajiit, I stalked slowly down the steps,
then picked the lock to their apartment door. It opened with nary a
squeak. Their backs were turned from the entrance -- a fatal mistake.

Dropping low I crouched behind their couch. Their guy at the computer
headed to the kitchen to get a drink; within a silent second the CD was
back in my hands.

Of course, then the instincts kicked in. I mean, hey, I was there … it's
not like the city guard had seen me. I could still carry plenty more
stuff in my bookbag. So, I grabbed the computer, too. And some cups and
plates. And some candlesticks. In hindsight, maybe I got a little
carried away. It was difficult to get a smoking barbecue off of their
patio and through their living room and up the steps to my apartment
without raising suspicion, but hey, once you're on a roll, it's hard to
stop…

[![](img/victimpics/thesauce.gif)](%ARTICLE[363]%){: .left} Ah, nothing helps
a man [recover from an eye injury](%ARTICLE[363]%) like a delicious
sizzling hot dog and a stolen roleplaying game. Speaking of which, how
is it? What? The computer's missing? Wow, that's crazy. Let's discuss
this over some 'dogs WHOA! The barbecue is gone! It was right here a
second ago … Hey … *what happened to my pants!?*
