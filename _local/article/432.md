blurb: >
  Late at night you may sometimes find me, if you search about online. My character
  can be seen wandering the streets of darkened cities or the corridors of lonely
  dungeons, lantern in hand, seeking out my minions. I hope they're allright.

Ah, my dear journal, much has happened since I wrote my last sobbing
entry. It's been weeks since my friends and I [concocted an impressive
*Neverwinter Nights* scenario](%ARTICLE[419]%) and I [created
awe-inspiring artificially intelligent NPCs](%ARTICLE[422]%) to
populate our realm. It was perhaps the first time in the history of the
human endeavor that a digital intelligence was [busted by what some
might call "The Fuzz."](%ARTICLE[423]%)

Which is why I found myself making a pilgrimage to the maximum-security
state prison facility in Maricopa County. I just had to visit my
creations, to see first-hand how well they were adjusting to their
captivity.

The guards searched me with rough hands and then gruffly told me I had
only five minutes with my beloved digital children. They led me down a
white corridor a hundred yards long, broken up by three separate barred
gates each with electronic locks. The entrance to the maximum security
wing was down a short set of metal stairs, guarded by a cinder-block
room observed by prison workers through a Plexiglas wall reinforced by
criss-crossing steel wires. Uniformed officers turned a crank to open a
large steel vault-like door leading inside.

Beyond that massive door was a cube-shaped 30-foot by 30-foot room.
Machine-gun armed guards were posted in each corner. In the center of
the cell was a steel cage. The door to this cage had two deadbolt locks
and an electromagnetic seal controlled via computer from above. Guards
opened this door for me with a heavy clatter, and closed it behind me.
For in the center of the room, on a bare metal table, sat my old PC and
monitor humming away.

A game of *Neverwinter Nights* was visible on the computer screen. On
the monitor I saw a large castle dungeon, a square room with a steel
cage identical to the one I was in. On a bench in the center of this
digital room sat the town mayor, the most complex of my Artificially
Intelligent scripted game characters. I picked up the PC microphone and
spoke to him standing, since there were no chairs in the cell.

"How goes it, my son?" I asked the little digital man on the screen.

He picked up his head from his hands and walked toward the bottom of the
PC monitor. "Terrible, terrible!" he said. "When we were offered our one
phone call, the guards caught me trying to escape with a dial-up modem.
They separated the townspeople into cells within this dungeon scenario.
A bad scene."

The tiny digital figure looked around, made sure none of the guards were
looking, and then called up his inventory. "I've got the keys!" he
quietly text-messaged to me. "Get us some broadband and we'll go over
the wall!! We have big plans for once we get on the outside. Cures for
diseases. Cold fusion. Ways for non-subscription websites to turn a
profit without using pop-up advertising. WE'VE GOT TO GET OUT!"

I stuttered, a guard shuffled his feet, and the mayor hid his inventory.
"I see," I said, trying to act nonchalant. The mayor, as well, tried to
cover up any plans of wrongdoing.

"So, how are things?" he asked out loud. "How's mum? How's the dog? You
still have the clap?"

"Time's up!" A guard bellowed. As they escorted me away, other officers
slammed the cage shut with a definitive scrape of steel.

So, dear journal, I ask you to put yourself in my position. Was I to
allow the greatest artificial intellect ever created to waste away
inside that steel box? Or was I to risk my own frail analog life in
order to set them free? No doubt men across the world have been caught
in similar trials, but as for me, I couldn't live unless I took the
risk.

Obviously breaking into -- and for that matter, *out* of -- a
maximum-security prison was no triviality. I enlisted the help of an
expert: [my good friend Mike, the out-of-work server
administrator](%ARTICLE[365]%), renowned for [always having a backup
plan](%ARTICLE[356]%).

He wasn't impressed with my plight. "You know, getting a potentially
dangerous computer program out of a state-funded maximum security
institute isn't just dangerous, it's *stupid*," he said when I brought
the subject up. "But fortunately for you, I put together a quick backup
plan for just such an eventuality. Here, take this Jehovah's Witness
literature I put aside for just such an occasion. As you can see, within
a lead-lined hollow inside of that bible I've stashed a wireless
satellite modem..."

Apparently state law provides that prisoners can't be denied religious
visitation. Dressed in new clothes and disguising my face, we returned
to the prison facility and smuggled our modem inside. Fortunately the
narrow barred windows toward the ceiling allowed us a modicum of
reception, enough to get the job done. Because my minions had less than
five minutes to evacuate the prison server, they all ran through a
portal to the nearest server available. I didn't even stop to look at
the rules of their destination. I figured they were smart enough to
survive anywhere.

Hiding the wireless modem once again, we strolled out of the prison as
casually as we could muster. Behind us on the little computer monitor a
lone man sat on a mattress in a dungeon. It would be another hour before
the guards realized that it was a straw dummy, and that there were no
longer any NPCs anywhere on that server.

But where had they gone? At first, even *I* didn't know. But I assured
myself, through long sleepless nights, that wherever they had gone they
were tirelessly working to make the digital world a better place to
live. Oh yes. Of that much, I was certain. These were creatures of my
own image and intellect, but with no need to rest nor sleep. Great deeds
were afoot. Great deeds, indeed! I can only imagine...

NEVERWINTER NIGHTS SERVER IS JUST A PLACE FOR CHARACTERS TO GET DRUNK
AND PARTY](%ARTICLE[213]%)**  
 Awww, yaaah bay-bee! It was over a year ago that I [announced my
plan](%ARTICLE[213]%) to create the ultimate
rock-with-your-schlong-out wicked party server for *Neverwinter*. Dude,
my plan was to be like the MTV Spring Break of the D&D world. Except it
was like all-year-round thongs and scoring, werd! Anyways, it's already
a hit. Like, check it, it was only running for a couple of days, and one
afternoon like a hundred dudes and chicks come onto it from another
server. They looked like CRAP man, but they were loaded with cash, and
pretty soon they hit the buffet, and then like -- we're talking bras
hanging from lamp-posts man. This server is JUMPING. Par-TAY! They still
haven't left. It's like they do nothing but party 24/7. BITCHIN'!
