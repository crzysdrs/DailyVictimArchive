Hello game developers. My name is unimportant, but my business is: My
business is *you*. How many times have you launched a new product on an
unsuspecting public only to be whalloped by an unfavorable reaction, as
though your software just broke out like a rash? Believe me, I know my
software ([as well as my rashes](%ARTICLE[94]%)), and I can help.

What you need is an in-depth beta-testing program sponsored by myself
and Mr. Puffytails here. I will personally put an alpha version of your
game through an extensive third-party quality assurance program while my
compatriot simulates catastrophic hardward failures by pelting our
standardized test equipment with nuts.

More importantly, I've acquired through my extensive MUD and IRC
connections a stable of the most hardcore gamers on the planet. Believe
me, nobody will put your game through the paces like a macho gaming
fanatic who has forsworn life and career just to relentlessly attack
your company and others like it on your own public messageboards. Why
allow these gamers to work against you when they can be working in YOUR
corner prior to your game's release? Just listen to some of the
valuable, *valuable* feedback they can give:

[![](img/victimpics/gamewillsuck.gif){: .left }](%ARTICLE[226]%)**I HAVEN'T
ACTUALLY INSTALLED THE GAME YET, BUT JUDGING FROM THE SHODDY QUALITY OF
THE PRINTING ON THIS CD CASE, IT'S GOING TO TOTALLY SUCK ASS. THE
SKILLED EYE CAN SPOT THESE THINGS.**
{: .clear }

[![](img/victimpics/colorquicksave.png){: .left }](%ARTICLE[166]%)**I SEE YOU
HAVE AN EASY-TO-USE QUICKSAVE FEATURE ON THIS GAME. THAT'S TERRIFIC.
WHILE YOU'RE AT IT, WHY NOT PUBLISH THE CHEAT CODES? BETTER YET, JUST
START THE PLAYER WITH UNLIMITED AMMO AND MAKE HIM INDESTRUCTABLE. I'D
PLAY.**
{: .clear}

[![](img/victimpics/smooth.gif){: .left }](%ARTICLE[220]%)**THIS GAME IS
WONDERFUL, AND THE COMMUNITY-BUILDING FEATURES ARE EXCELLENT. BUT I WAS
WONDERING WHY YOU DIDN'T INCLUDE A SECURE PRIVATE PLAYER-TO-PLAYER CHAT
SYSTEM, YOU KNOW, IN CASE I SCORE SOME PRIVATE TIME WITH THE HOOCHES.**
{: .clear}

[![](img/victimpics/colorspeaker.png){: .left }](%ARTICLE[101]%)**YOUR SOUND
SEEMS TO BE BUGGY ON THE LOW END. I HAVE AN 8.5 SPEAKER SURROUND SOUND
SYSTEM, AND I FULLY EXPECT THAT THE BLAST OF A MORTAR SHOULD ACT AS A
POWERFUL DIURETIC.**
{: .clear}

[![](img/victimpics/german.gif){: .left }](%ARTICLE[216]%)**THERE AREN'T
ENOUGH NAZIS!**
{: .clear}

[![](img/victimpics/coloracjob.png){: .left }](%ARTICLE[41]%)**YEAH, THIS IS
GREAT AND ALL, BUT I WAS WONDERING HOW GUYS LIKE ME COULD MAKE MONEY OFF
OF YOUR PRODUCT ON E-BAY? YOU SHOULD CONSIDER PUTTING MORE RARE AND
UNUSUAL ITEMS IN THERE THAT I CAN SELL FOR BIG DUCATS. THANKS.**
{: .clear}

[![](img/victimpics/colorwizard.png){: .left }](%ARTICLE[119]%)**FOR YOUR
MULTIPLAYER BACK-END SOLUTION I SEE YOU'VE CHOSEN TO USE A LAMENTABLE NT
SERVER ARCHITECTURE. I WON'T BORE YOU WITH THE SECURITY HOLES I'VE
FOUND, HOWEVER, FOR A SMALL FEE I WILL SELL YOU BACK YOUR LIST OF
CD-KEYS AND CREDIT CARD NUMBERS THAT I ACQUIRED.**
