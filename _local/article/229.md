No, I mean it. This time we're through. He and I got together 'cuz we
were both regulars on the LAN terminals at the Wizards of the Coast
store, and he was all into the game, a real player. [As I said
before](%ARTICLE[221]%), nothing really turns me on more than a man
who knows how to handle a big Havoc heavy Transport. He always carried a
full load, if you catch me.

At first I totally thought he was the one, you know? Sorta a lifetime
clanmate. We got along great. We'd plant turrets and pulse sensors
together on Saturdays. Then, you know, after the sun set? He could go
*alllll night*. You know how some guys just rush for the flag and don't
take the time to -- you know -- "get their base all set up?" Not him. He
took it long and slow.

But anyways, it only lasted a couple of weeks. I came in early one
Thursday night, when normally I'm supposed to be working? And I caught
him playing for the other team. He couldn't weasel his way out of this
one, I walked in and saw him all the way inside the other base.

"I was - uh -- just looking for where they put their turrets!" he said.
What-evar. I caught him wearing another man's heavies. I let him have it
right then and there: told him we were through. Then I satchel charged
his gens.

Oh no, he's here. Here he comes.

[![](img/victimpics/colorboyfriendbig.png){: .right }](%ARTICLE[214]%)**SO I
PLAYED AROUND A LITTLE ON THE SIDE. IT DOESN'T MEAN I DON'T LOVE OUR
CLAN, BABY.**  
 Look, I'm not saying I'm a saint, I'm just sayin' that she can be a
hard woman to date. Every time I turned my back some dude from Blood
Eagle was zappin' her with his ELF projector. After a while it was
ridiculous, it was like she enjoyed it.
{: .clear}

"Hey, quit Elfin' my girlfriend!" I typed.

They told me that if she was getting enough ELFin' at home she wouldn't
be lookin' for it elsewhere. Dude. That's so embarassing.

Besides, I only, uh, played for the other team once. Look, most guys,
you know, they experiment with other teams. It's not like it makes them
less of a clan, you know what I mean?

[![](img/victimpics/colortribesgirl.png){: .left }](%ARTICLE[214]%)**WHAT
ABOUT THAT TIME I CAUGHT YOU DEFENDING SHELLY'S BASE, CREEP?**  
 Don't try to lie to me -- I walked in and your turret was fully
erected.

[![](img/victimpics/colorboyfriend.png){: .left }](%ARTICLE[214]%)**AW C'MON
BABY, THAT WAS A ONE-TIME THING**  
 She was all alone in that base, baby, and I had the tools and talent.
She meant nothing to me, I just did it for her flag. Honest. She was an
old flame, you know? It was a sympathy dee. It won't happen again.
