Some would say that the humble pigeon has no place in a game of
Counter-Strike, much as the chicken is always the first to be
obliterated in a game of CS on the Italy map. I wholeheartedly disagree!
The use of homing pigeons not only increases your team's ability to come
from behind, but raising and caring for them from little itty-bitty
chicks is a reward in and of itself.

Here's the way it works. Let's say everyone on your team is dead but for
one guy, and he's hunting the single remaining enemy. You know where the
enemy is camping, but how can you tell your friend? The game won't let
you chat and your modem is using up your phone line. THAT, my friend, is
why hardcore gamers like myself keep homing messenger pigeons handy.

But, let's talk practicalities. During a good evening of Counter-Strike
you're going to need a pen of roughly a dozen birds. Keep pencils and
paper handy and be prepared to write quickly. As soon as the situation
looks desperate, write off a note and send the pigeon with the message
to your teammate.

I highly recommend short and to the point notes. For one thing, you
won't have a lot of time to write. For another, your friend will have to
take his hands off of the controls in order to untie the note from the
pigeon. And most importantly, you don't want to cause any confusion
should your note fall into the *wrong hands!* For these reasons keep
your notes short:

"In garage w/ hostages"  
 "On roof over hot tub"  
 "Crouched in wine cellar"

Armed with this knowledge your team will gain a great advantage! Plus,
you'll have the loving affection of dozens of cooing foul.

 Yeah, Johnson was eating french fries outside the precinct when some
bird landed and started beggin'. He blew its head off and then noticed
that the body had a note attached: "Bomb under train in courtyard." Yep,
another threat. You know what to do; close the station, evacuate the
civvies, call in the bomb squad..."
