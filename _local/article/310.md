  Influence of Such Subversive Games as WWF Raw

It's getting harder and harder to protect America's youth because more
and more frequently the establishment frowns on my use of excessive
force or non-rubber bullets. That's why I've started developing my
second biggest muscle: my *skull.*

I heard word that [some young punks](%ARTICLE[304]%) are getting
ready to [start a riot at my beloved mall](%ARTICLE[306]%) today.
Being the sole security personnel of Irvine Park Mall, 100% responsible
for the sanctity of this retail domicile, it's my sworn duty to start
crippling people.

I got to be ready to move fast, zip from one end of the mall to another.
That's why I got me a set of wheels: The GolfPro A55. Look, I play *Gran
Turismo*, I know how this works. I souped this thing to get more torque
than a tractor trailer. I've left a trail of black tire streaks all the
way from the WhattaPretzel to Ye Olde Country Cell Phone Shoppe. I'm
ready for combat.

You know what I blame? It's the video games these days. The biggest hit
last year was that, uh, "Poke a Man" game. I'm not sure exactly how it
worked because I haven't played it, but apparently it's about training
animals to kill. That's disgusting. *People* should kill; animals should
merely fetch the bodies.

And another thing, don't these kids have any priorities? There's one guy
who's been [camping in front of the software store](%ARTICLE[307]%)
since before I was hired. There's something in the Constitution that
forbids me from attacking him with a weed-eater, at least, that's what
they tell me. But I'm certain he's behind this whole "Riot" business.
So, at the first sign of trouble, I'm going to run over his legs and
pretend it was an "accident." It's like I always say -- any good
civilian repression plan is only 10% sweat but 95% planning.

If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go "guard" the Victoria's Secret some
more.
