title: Guys, guys -- the problem here, as I see it, is that our *entire team* is a
  bunch of Support Slackers.

Last week when I talked about how [I invented Support Slacking in
*PlanetSide*](%ARTICLE[601]%), I thought I had pretty much perfected
it. In fact, I had 12 battle ranks and a tank. I had settled comfortably
into the role of "Heavy Support Slacker."

But then I got hooked up with you guys as a squad, and you make me look
like frickin' GI-Joe. Look at you! What are you doing? This one guy here
grabbed that Basilisk and for the last ten minutes he's been hiding it
in a shrubbery.

It took us two and a half hours to get to an enemy-held base, because we
were all just ambling about trying to follow at a safe distance behind
one another.

Now, here we are, we're actually AT an enemy installation, and not ONE
of us is making a move toward it. We're all hovering at about the
distance we need to be to get experience points should the base fall.
Needless to say, not one of us has fired a shot. I don't think the enemy
even knows we're here.

Come to think of it, I don't think the enemy is even *there*. Have you
seen anyone? Heard a peep? Seen even a hint of a helmet? Me neither.
Gentlemen ... I think that this enemy base is abandoned.

Oh, HELL no. I'm not going in. There might be a guy in there. And even
if there wasn't, I'd have to put down my drink. No sir, I'm just
commenting on the situation. You know. In case any of you slackers
wanted to take action.
