  Hi. I need to buy 16 dozen eggs, and a fifth of vodka. However, I can't reach my
  wallet.

What are you looking at? So I'm a big giant bunny, woo hoo, just give me
the whiskey and shut the hell up. I've had a rough week. You heard I
lost that [lousy job at the Gaming GigaBuys software
store](%ARTICLE[106]%) because [some punk attacked me with a
monkey](%ARTICLE[160]%) the day Tribes 2 came out? Animal Services
was all over my ass like a rash. How was I to know he was a monkey? I
couldn't see a damned thing in that bear suit. I thought it was [another
brat trying to stuff me in a Pokeball](%ARTICLE[122]%), so I slammed
him into the software shelves. Anyways, somehow this is MY FAULT. But
they let me off with community service.

Yeah. So now I haveta be the neighborhood Easter bunny. I tried to get
out of it. I told them I didn't believe in the Easter bunny. I said I
was Jewish. I told them I swell up if I get near eggs. Didn't work. So
yeah, lookat me, software store dropout. "*Here comes Peter Cottontail /
Straight from Marin County Jail...*" Stop laughing! If I had opposable
thumbs in this thing I WOULD CUT YOU.

Okay, hand me my basket of eggs. I have to go entertain the freaks in
this neighborhood. If a guy with a monkey comes in here, hold him down
and beat him for me.

ANOTHER EGG! THANK YOU, I'LL SAVE IT FOR LATER.**  
 Thanks, large bunny man. This egg will come in handy ... sometime. I'd
eat it now, but I have [this terrible quick-saving
addiction](%ARTICLE[166]%) which has caused me to habitually horde
all of my ammo and powerups rather than use them. Here, look at this
special refrigerator. It contains every single Easter Egg I've ever
received since 1977, rack after multicolored, glimmering rack. You never
know when I might need ... eggs. And I would hate to, you know, have
used them ... frivolously.

[![](img/victimpics/colorwizard.jpg)](%ARTICLE[119]%){: .left}**AH! YOUR
SACRIFICE OF RIPENED CHICKEN OVARIES HAS PLEASED THE MOST DIVINE SERVER
ADMINISTRATOR**  
 Indeed, ceremonial hare, this weekend marks a most important
anniversary to celebrate. Yes, what was once dead was remade anew.
That's right ... exactly ten years ago Linus Torvalds began work on
Linux! Your gift shall not be in vain, I'll add another two megabytes to
your mail account. Begone quickly and I shall make it three. Off. OFF!

&nbsp;

[![](img/victimpics/colorvrguy.jpg)](%ARTICLE[111]%){: .left}**VIRTUAL
REALITY GAMING HAS SOME DEFINITE DRAWBACKS**  
 Believe me, I love getting lost in a virtual world. There's nothing
quite as immersive as my [incredible VR setup](%ARTICLE[111]%), even
though it causes occasional property damage. But woo-ee, did I get quite
the scare tonight!

See, I was embroiled in an ultra-realistic game of Asheron's Call,
wandering about in the 3D environment. Finally, I decided to take a
break, so I took off the goggles and set them on the coffee table. And
what do I see standing in the doorframe of my apartment but *an enormous
bunny!* I'm not making this up. I looked down at the goggles and back at
the door and realized that it was all a clever trick, see, I only
THOUGHT I had taken the goggles off, but really I was still wearing them
and standing in an amazing lifelike virtual representation of my
apartment. How else could you explain why there was an enormous
rabbitbeast standing in my doorway? "Happy Easter numbnuts, you wanna
egg or you gonna stand there like a jag-off?" the bunny said, without
moving his big bunny mouth.

Well, I had to think fast, and you know as well as I do that [killing
bunnies is worth phat rips of
XP](http://web.archive.org/web/20010413000000/http://www.gamespy.com/legacy/fargo/bunnies_a.shtm).
So I pulled out my broadsword -- which for reasons I'd rather not
discuss was lodged into the remains of my couch at the time -- and
charged at him. "TO THE ABYSS WITH THEE!" I yelled.

To my surprise, the bunny fought back! He simply braced himself in the
doorframe and leveled me with a vicious [Foot of
Fury](%ARTICLE[126]%) to my chest. Eggs flew everywhere and I
crashed to the floor with a thud, my sword skittering under the dining
room table.

"That's it punk bi-atoch!" the bunny said, throwing off his white
mittens and rolling up big furry sleeves. "The cops'll call this
self-defense!" Then he stuck out his elbow and dropped onto me from
above, ears flapping the whole way. He cracked a few ribs and I howled
out in pain. I rolled on top of him and started beating his big bunny
face with my fists, loud squeaking sounds emanating from the beast's
grinning maw with each impact.

At this point my girlfriend came in and saw me locked in mortal combat
with a giant bunny amidst a pile of broken eggs. "Don't worry, honey!" I
shouted above the din. "None of this is real! That's not air you're
breathing..." Then the bunny rolled me over and kneed me in the balls,
which certainly *felt* real. "I AM THE CHOSEN ONE!" I hollered, sending
the rabbit flying with a kick. He righted himself and struck a kung-fu
pose -- then suddenly his torn rabbit ears perked up at the sound of
police sirens, and he took off running.

"Follow the white rabbit!" I screamed at my girlfriend. But, instead,
she opted to slap me silly.
